  "content": "<p>My thanks to WorkOS for sponsoring DF last week. Connecting user accounts to third-party APIs always comes with the same plumbing: OAuth flows, token storage, refresh logic, and provider-specific quirks. WorkOS Pipes removes that overhead. Users connect services like GitHub, Slack, Google, Salesforce, and other supported providers through a drop-in widget. Your back end requests a valid access token from the Pipes API when needed, while Pipes handles credential storage and token refresh. That’s it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://workos.com/docs/pipes?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=q12026&amp;utm_content=simplify_integrations_cta\">Simplify your integrations with WorkOS Pipes</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/15/workos-pipes\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘WorkOS Pipes’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"
