That feeling of loss though can be hard to understand emotionally for people my age who entered tech because we were addicted to feeling of agency it gave us. The web was objectively awful as a technology, and genuinely amazing, and nobody got into it because programming in Perl was somehow aesthetically delightful.</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://laughingmeme.org/2026/02/09/code-has-always-been-the-easy-part.html\">Kellan Elliott-McCrea</a>, Code has <em>always</em> been the easy part</p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/perl\">perl</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/kellan-elliott-mccrea\">kellan-elliott-mccrea</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/agentic-engineering\">agentic-engineering</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/deep-blue\">deep-blue</a></p>"
