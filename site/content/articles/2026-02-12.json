      "content": "<p>Andrew Cunningham, writing for Ars Technica at the end of January:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple also outlines a number of usage restrictions for the\ngenerative AI features that rely on external services. Apple says\nthat, “at a minimum,” users will be able to generate 50 images, 50\npresentations of between 8 to 10 slides each, and to generate\npresenter notes in Keynote for 700 slides. More usage may be\npossible, but this depends on “the complexity of the queries,\nserver availability, and network availability.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/116008952067084300\">Steven Troughton-Smith</a>, last week, after creating an entire app with OpenAI’s Codex:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This entire app used 7% of my weekly Codex usage limit. Compare\nthat to a single (awful) slideshow in Keynote using 47% of my\nmonthly Apple Creator Studio usage limit 👀</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Something feels off here, by at least an order of magnitude (maybe two?), that creating an entire good app costs way less than creating one shitty slide deck in Keynote. It should be the other way around.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/11/apple-creator-studio-usage-restrictions\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Apple Creator Studio Usage Restrictions’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",

      "content": "<p>This is one of those small things that drives me nuts.</p>\n<p>Why? I don’t know. I think it has something to do with the fact that I have a computer that is faster than any computer I’ve ever used in my entire life — and yet, clicking on buttons results in slight but perceptible delays.</p>\n<p>Let me explain.</p>\n<p>Imagine a button that looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language language-jsx\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-title class_\">Button</span>\n  onClick={<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">async</span> () =&gt; {\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> data = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">getSessionUrlFromStripe</span>(id);\n    <span class=\"hljs-variable language_\">window</span>.<span class=\"hljs-property\">location</span> = data.<span class=\"hljs-property\">url</span>;\n  }\n&gt;<span class=\"hljs-title class_\">Upgrade</span> to <span class=\"hljs-title class_\">Pro</span>&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-title class_\">Button</span>&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>For SPA apps, when the user clicks that button it takes a split second (even on a fast connection) for anything to happen because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The browser makes a request to the server</li>\n<li>The server talks to Stripe to get a session</li>\n<li>The server responds with the session data to the client</li>\n<li>The client redirects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When clicking on that button, even on a fast connection, my brain glitches for a second, my thought process going something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I click</li>\n<li>[nothing happens]</li>\n<li>I think “Did that work?”</li>\n<li>Just as I’m about to click again, I see the URL bar change</li>\n<li>I think, “Oh, ok, it’s doing <em>something</em>.”</li>\n<li>I stop myself from clicking again while I wait for the UI to redraw</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Granted those thoughts occur in my brain in under a second, but I hate that pause of indetermination.</p>\n<p>I clicked, I want (perceptibly) <em>instant</em> feedback. If something is happening, tell me!</p>\n<p>For SPA apps, you could put some state in there, like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language language-jsx\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> [isLoading, setIsLoading] = <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">useState</span>(<span class=\"hljs-literal\">false</span>);\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> (\n  <span class=\"language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">Button</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">onClick</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">{async</span> () =&gt;</span> {\n    setIsLoading(true);\n    const data = await getSessionUrlFromStripe(id);\n    window.location = data.url;\n  }\n  &gt;{isLoading ? &#x27;Upgrading...&#x27; : &#x27;Upgrade to Pro&#x27;}<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">Button</span>&gt;</span></span>\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would provide more immediate feedback. But it also raises a whole set of other questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is that actually the interaction you want, where the text changes? That’s probably gonna shift layout. Maybe you want something different, like a spinner in place of the text. How do you handle that?</li>\n<li>What if you have multiple places to upgrade? Do you have to implement <code>isLoading</code> state in all those places too? What if the trigger in each place is slightly different? A button here, some text there, and icon over yonder? How do you handle all of those different interactions in a standard, immediate way?</li>\n<li>Errors. What if it fails? Well, we already weren’t handling that in the first code example were we? But maybe we should…</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh boy, this is getting complicated isn’t it?</p>\n<p>This is why, I assume, lots of apps just don’t deal with it. </p>\n<p>They accept there will be a slight delay in the responsiveness of the UI (and that it might error, but the user can just click again) and justify that it’s really not that big of a deal if there’s a slight, almost imperceptible delay between clicking a button and seeing the UI respond.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got bigger fish to fry.”</p>\n<p>And it makes sense. I mean, a slight delay in UI responsiveness, is that why people will or won’t buy your thing? Seems like a small detail. Who’s got the time to spend on details like this?Who cares? </p>\n<p>I care. That’s why I’m writing this post.</p>\n<p>To my original point, every piece of hardware I currently own is the fastest version of that device I’ve ever had in my life. And yet, everywhere I go I encounter lag. <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/jason/the-big-regression-da7fc60d\">Lag everywhere.</a></p>\n<p>And I’m grumpy about it, hence this post.</p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/unresponsive-buttons/\">Email</a>\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>",

      "content": "<p>As a formal methods consultant I have to mathematically express properties of systems. I generally do this with two \"temporal operators\": </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A(x) means that <code>x</code> is always true. For example, a database table <em>always</em> satisfies all record-level constraints, and a state machine <em>always</em> makes valid transitions between states. If <code>x</code> is a statement about an individual state (as in the database but not state machine example), we further call it an <strong>invariant</strong>.</li>\n<li>E(x) means that <code>x</code> is \"eventually\" true, conventionally meaning \"guaranteed true at some point in the future\". A database transaction <em>eventually</em> completes or rolls back, a state machine <em>eventually</em> reaches the \"done\" state, etc. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>These come from linear temporal logic, which is the mainstream notation for expressing system properties. <sup id=\"fnref:modal\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:modal\">1</a></sup> We like these operators because they elegantly cover <a href=\"https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/safety-and-liveness/\" target=\"_blank\">safety and liveness properties</a>, and because <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/formalizing-stability-and-resilience-properties/\" target=\"_blank\">we can combine them</a>. <code>A(E(x))</code> means <code>x</code> is true an infinite number of times, while <code>A(x =&gt; E(y)</code> means that <code>x</code> being true guarantees <code>y</code> true in the future. </p>\n<p>There's a third class of properties, that I will call <em>possibility</em> properties: <code>P(x)</code> is \"can x happen in this model\"? Is it possible for a table to have more than ten records? Can a state machine transition from \"Done\" to \"Retry\", even if it <em>doesn't</em>? Importantly, <code>P(x)</code> does not need to be possible <em>immediately</em>, just at some point in the future. It's possible to lose 100 dollars betting on slot machines, even if you only bet one dollar at a time. If <code>x</code> is a statement about an individual state, we can further call it a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reachability\" target=\"_blank\"><em>reachability</em> property</a>. I'm going to use the two interchangeably for flow. </p>\n<p><code>A(P(x))</code> says that <code>x</code> is <em>always</em> possible. No matter what we've done in our system, we can make <code>x</code> happen again. There's no way to do this with just <code>A</code> and <code>E</code>. Other meaningful combinations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>P(A(x))</code>: there is a reachable state from which <code>x</code> is always true.</li>\n<li><code>A(x =&gt; P(y))</code>: <code>y</code> is possible from any state where <code>x</code> is true.</li>\n<li><code>E(x &amp;&amp; P(y))</code>: There is always a future state where x is true and y is reachable.</li>\n<li><code>A(P(x) =&gt; E(x))</code>: If <code>x</code> is ever possible, it will eventually happen.</li>\n<li><code>E(P(x))</code> and <code>P(E(x))</code> are the same as <code>P(x)</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the paper <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/567446.567463\" target=\"_blank\">\"Sometime\" is sometimes \"not never\"</a> for a deeper discussion of <code>E</code> and <code>P</code>.</p>\n<h3>The use case</h3>\n<p>Possibility properties are \"something good <em>can</em> happen\", which is generally less useful (<em>in specifications</em>) than \"something bad <em>can't</em> happen\" (safety) and \"something good <em>will</em> happen\" (liveness). But it still comes up as an important property! My favorite example:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A guy who can't shut down his computer because system preferences interrupts shutdown\" class=\"newsletter-image\" src=\"https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/safety-and-liveness/img/tweet2.png\" /></p>\n<p>The big use I've found for the idea is as a sense-check that we wrote the spec properly. Say I take the property \"A worker in the 'Retry' state eventually leaves that state\":</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>A(state == 'Retry' =&gt; E(state != 'Retry'))\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The model checker checks this property and confirms it holds of the spec. Great! Our system is correct! ...Unless the system can never <em>reach</em> the \"Retry\" state, in which case the expression is trivially true. I need to verify that 'Retry' is reachable, eg <code>P(state == 'Retry')</code>. Notice I can't use <code>E</code> to do this, because I don't want to say \"the worker always needs to retry at least once\". </p>\n<h3>It's not supported though</h3>\n<p>I say \"use I've found for <em>the idea</em>\" because the main formalisms I use (Alloy and TLA+) don't natively support <code>P</code>. <sup id=\"fnref:tla\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:tla\">2</a></sup> On top of <code>P</code> being less useful than <code>A</code> and <code>E</code>, simple reachability properties are <a href=\"https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/software-mimicry/\" target=\"_blank\">mimickable</a> with A(x). <code>P(x)</code> <em>passes</em> whenever <code>A(!x)</code> <em>fails</em>, meaning I can verify <code>P(state == 'Retry')</code> by testing that <code>A(!(state == 'Retry'))</code> finds a counterexample.

I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet&#8217;s control servers.</p>\n<p>Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">abnormally large</a> distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.</p>\n<p>I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender&#8217;s and receiver&#8217;s locations,&#8221; the <a href=\"https://i2p.net/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I2P website explains</a>. &#8220;The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On February 3, I2P users began <a href=\"https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/issues/2312#issuecomment-3875275177\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">complaining on the organization&#8217;s GitHub page</a> about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes.

What use could I have a mechanical keyboard festooned with lights?</p>\n\n<img alt=\"A brightly multicoloured mess of a keyboard with a USB cable and keytool on it.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67568\" height=\"891\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/keyboard.webp\" width=\"2040\" />\n\n<p>The good folks at <a href=\"https://epomaker.com/\">Epomaker</a> want me to see the error of my ways and have sent me a couple of devices to review. Today I'm trying out the <a href=\"https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-th87\">TH87</a> and it is surprisingly lovely!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"blinken-lights\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-th87-iso-mechanical-keyboard/#blinken-lights\">Blinken lights!</a></h2>\n\n<p>Here's a quick video showing some of the effects.</p>\n\n<p></p><div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 620px;\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"349\" id=\"video-67546-2\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"620\"><source src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/th87-new.mp4?_=2\" type=\"video/mp4\" /><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/th87-new.mp4\">https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/th87-new.mp4</a></video></div><p></p>\n\n<p>Is this <em>necessary</em>? No! But it is jolly good fun. Probably a bit distracting - especially if you're in a dark space or a crowded office - but rather pleasing nevertheless. Switching between the effects means remembering the correct key combo - there's no way to do it programatically, you just have to cycle through them all.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"linux-compatibility\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-th87-iso-mechanical-keyboard/#linux-compatibility\">Linux Compatibility</a></h2>\n\n<p>The TH87 comes with a USB-C to A cable. Personally, I'd've preferred straight C-C, but this does the job. Flick the switch at the back to USB mode, plug it in, and Linux instantly detected it. No drivers to configure.</p>\n\n<p>Rather cheekily, <code>lsusb</code> shows it as <code>05ac:0250 Apple, Inc. Aluminium Keyboard (ISO)</code> - there's another switch for changing between Mac and PC mode. That doesn't change how the keyboard presents itself; just the keycodes it sends.</p>\n\n<p>Oddly, there was this warning in <code>dmesg</code>:</p>\n\n<p><code>apple 0003:05AC:0250.0010: Fn key not found (Apple Wireless Keyboard clone?), disabling Fn key handling</code></p>\n\n<p>However, the function keys worked and I was able to control screen brightness etc using <kbd>Fn</kbd> and the <kbd>F1-12</kbd> keys.</p>\n\n<p>There's also a Bluetooth option. Again, Linux use was a breeze - although you'll have to remember what the pairing combo is and which device it is paired to.</p>\n\n<p>There's also a 2.4GHz option. Hidden under one of the feet is a little USB-A receiver. Again, pairing is simple - just plug it in and flick the switch.</p>\n\n<p>As expected, it also plays well with Android. The Bluetooth connection worked as did USB-OTG. Of course, quite <em>why</em> you'd want a giant heavy keyboard paired to your tiny phone is an exercise left to the reader.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"clunk-click-every-trip\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-th87-iso-mechanical-keyboard/#clunk-click-every-trip\">Clunk Click Every Trip</a></h2>\n\n<img alt=\"A keyboard with a UK layout and lots of colourful lights.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67566\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EPOMAKER_TH87_ISO_UK_9.webp\" width=\"1131\" />\n\n<p>So let's talk about noise. This keyboard is noisier than some of my other typing surfaces, but not aggressively so. Apparently it is \"pre-lubricated\" and has some noise suppression. The travel on the switches is excellent, they aren't stiff, and the whole contraption is sturdy.</p>\n\n<p>It was easy to remove the caps with the enclosed tool. I didn't bother trying to extract a switch because I'm afraid of buggering it up.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-things\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-th87-iso-mechanical-keyboard/#other-things\">Other Things</a></h2>\n\n<p>Battery life is excellent - as you'd expect from a 10,000 mAh unit. It recommends charging by attaching to a computer and warns a regular charger might damage it. But, frankly, it seemed to cope just fine.</p>\n\n<p>There's no software for customising the colours or functionality. Apparently lots of mechanical keyboards run an Open Source firmware - but this appears to be proprietary.  There is some question about whether Epomaker comply with the GPL when it comes to the <a href=\"https://docs.qmk.fm/license_violations\">QMK source</a>. They appear to have <a href=\"https://github.com/Epomaker?tab=repositories\">some source code available</a> but it is hard to tell whether it exists for this specific model. I've contacted them for clarification.</p>\n\n<p>There's a <em>lot</em> of technobabble on the website. Apparently it uses \"5-Layer Sound Optimizing Design with PORON Sandwich Foam, IXPE Switch Pad, Sound Enhancement Pad, EPDM Switch Socket Pad, and Silicone Bottom\". I've no ideas what it means, but it appears important to some people.</p>\n\n<p>There's no number-pad, which is a bit of a shame. However the keyboard has a proper UK layout and is reasonably compact. Although at 1Kg it is almost as heavy as my laptop!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cost\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-th87-iso-mechanical-keyboard/#cost\">Cost</a></h2>\n\n<p>I have no internal benchmark for something like this. It's around <a href=\"https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2RJxZJd\">£60 from AliExpress</a> or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4qaSRMf\">£80 on Amazon UK</a> depending on whether you have pleased The Algorithm. That seems pretty reasonable for a hefty keyboard with lots of customisability.</p>\n\n<p>If you want ALL THE LIGHTS and value the ability to hot-swap various keys and switches, I think this is a nifty bit of kit.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Last year, all my non-programmer friends were building apps. Yet today, those apps are nowhere to be found.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone followed the ads. They signed up for Lovable and all the fancy app-building services that exist. My LinkedIn feed was filled with PMs who had discovered new powers. Some posted bullet-point lists of \"things to do to be successful with AI.\" \"Don't work hard, work smart,\" they said, as if it were a deep insight.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>I must admit, I was a bit jealous. With a full-time job, I don't get to work on my cool side project, which has collected enough dust to turn into a dune. There's probably a little mouse living inside. I'll call him Muad'Dib. </p>\n\n<p>What was I talking about? Right. The apps.</p>\n\n<p>Today, my friends are silent. I still see the occasional post on LinkedIn, but they don't garner the engagement they used to. The app-building AI services still exist, but their customers have paused their subscriptions. Here's a conversation I had recently.</p>\n\n<p>A friend had \"vibe-coded\" an Android app. A platform for building communities around common interests. Biking enthusiasts could start a biking community. Cooking fans could gather around recipes. It was a neat idea. While using the app on his phone, swiping through different pages and watching the slick animations, I felt a bit jealous. Then I asked: \"So where is the data stored?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"It's stored on the app,\" he replied.</p>\n\n<p>\"I mean, <em>all</em> the user data,\" I pressed. \"Do you use a database on AWS, or any service like that?\"</p>\n\n<p>We went back and forth while I tried to clarify my question. His vibe-knowing started to show its limits. I felt some relief, my job was safe for now. Joking aside, we talked about servers, app architecture, and even GDPR compliance. These weren't things the AI builder had prepared him for.</p>\n\n<p>This conversation happens often now when I check in on friends who vibe-coded their way into developing an app or website. They felt on top of the world when they were getting started. But then they got stuck. An error message they couldn't debug. The service generating gibberish. Requests the AI couldn't understand. How do you build the backend of an app when you don't know what a backend is? And when the tool asks you to sign up for Google Cloud and start paying monthly fees, what are you supposed to do?</p>\n\n<p>Another friend wanted to build a newsletter. Right now, ChatGPT told him to set up WordPress and learn about SMTP. These are all good things to learn, but the \"S\" in SMTP is a lie. It's not that simple. I've been trying to explain to him why the email he is sending from the command line is not reaching his gmail.</p>\n\n<p>The AI services that promise to build applications are great at making a storefront you don't want to modify. The moment you start customizing, you run into problems. That's why all Lovable websites look exactly the same. These services continue to exist. The marketing is still effective. But few people end up with a product that actually solves their problems.</p>\n\n<p>My friends spent money on these services. They were excited to see a polished brochure. The problem is, they didn't know what it takes to actually run an app.</p>\n\n<p>The AI tools are amazing at generating the visible 20% of an app. But the remaining invisible 80% is where the actual work is. The infrastructure, the security, maintenance, scaling issues, and then the actual cost. The free tier on AWS doesn't last forever. And neither does your enthusiasm when you start paying $200/month for a hobby project. </p>\n\n<p>My friends' experiments weren't failures. They learned something valuable. Some now understand why developers get paid what they do. Some even started taking programming bootcamp. But the rest have moved on. Their app sits dormant in an abandoned github repo. Their domain will probably expire this year.</p>\n\n<p>They're back to their day jobs, a little wiser about the difference between a demo and a product. Their LinkedIn profiles are quieter now, they have stopped posting about \"working smart, not hard.\"</p>\n\n<p>As for me, I should probably check on Muad'Dib. That side project isn't going to build itself. AI or no AI.</p>",

Publishers, editors, distributors and booksellers all do important work, allowing writers to get on with their writing, taking all the other parts of the publishing process off their shoulders.</p>\n<p>That's the value of platforms. The <em>danger</em> of platforms is when they grow so powerful that they usurp the relationship between the parties they are supposed to be facilitating, locking them in and then extracting value from them (someone should coin a word to describe this process!):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/07/usurpers-helpmeets/#disreintermediation\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/07/usurpers-helpmeets/#disreintermediation</a></p>\n<p>Everyone needs platforms: writers, social media users, people looking for a romantic partner. What's more, the <em>world</em> needs platforms. Say you want to connect all 200+ countries on Earth with high-speed fiber lines; you can run a cable from each country to every other country (about 21,000 cables, many of them expensively draped across the ocean floor), or you can pick one country (preferably one with both Atlantic and Pacific coasts) and run all your cables there, and then interconnect them.</p>\n<p>That's America, the world's global fiber hub. The problem is, America isn't just a platform for fiber interconnections &#8211; it's a Great Power that uses its position at the center of the world's fiber networks to surveil and disrupt the world's communications networks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden</a></p>\n<p>That's a classic enshittification move on a geopolitical scale. It's not the only one America's made, either.</p>\n<p>Consider the US dollar. The dollar is to global commerce what America's fiber head-ends are to the world's data network: a site of essential, (nominally) neutral interchange that is actually a weapon that the US uses to gain advantage over its allies and to punish its enemies:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties\">https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties</a></p>\n<p>The world's also got about 200 currencies. For parties in one country to trade with those in another country, the buyer needs to possess a currency the seller can readily spend. The problem is that setting up 21,000 pairwise exchange markets from every currency to every other currency is expensive and cumbersome &#8211; traders would have to amass reserves of hundreds of rarely used currencies, or they would have to construct long, brittle, expensive, high-risk chains that convert, say, Thai baht into Icelandic kroner to Brazilian reals and finally into Costa Rican colones.</p>\n<p>Thanks to a bunch of complicated maneuvers following World War II, the world settled on the US dollar as its currency platform. Most important international transactions use \"dollar clearing\" (where goods are priced in USD irrespective of their country of origin) and buyers need only find someone who will convert their currency to dollars in order to buy food, oil, and other essentials.</p>\n<p>There are two problems with this system. The first is that America has never treated the dollar as a neutral platform; rather, American leaders have found subtle, deniable ways to use \"dollar dominance\" to further America's geopolitical agenda, at the expense of other dollar users (you know, \"enshittification\"). The other problem is that America has become steadily <em>less</em> deniable and subtle in these machinations, finding all kinds of \"exceptional circumstances\" to use the dollar against dollar users:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack</a></p>\n<p>America's unabashed dollar weaponization has been getting worse for years, but under Trump, the weaponized dollar has come to constitute an existential risk to the rest of the world, sending them scrambling for alternatives. As November Kelly says, Trump inherited a poker game that was rigged in his favor, but he still flipped over the table because he resents having to pretend to play at all:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/26/i-dont-want/#your-greenback-dollar\">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/26/i-dont-want/#your-greenback-dollar</a></p>\n<p>Once Trump tried to steal Greenland, it became apparent that the downsides of the dollar far outweigh its upsides. Last month, Christine Lagarde (president of the European Central Bank) made a public announcement on a radio show that Europe \"urgently\" needed to build its own payment system to avoid the American payment duopoly, Visa/Mastercard:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://davekeating.substack.com/p/can-europe-free-itself-from-visamastercard\">https://davekeating.substack.com/p/can-europe-free-itself-from-visamastercard</a></p>\n<p>Now, there's plenty of reasons to want to avoid Visa/Mastercard, starting with cost: the companies have raised their prices by more than 40% since the pandemic started (needless to say, updating database entries has not gotten 40% more expensive since 2020). This allows two American companies to impose a tax on the entire global economy, collecting swipe fees and other commissions on $24t worth of the world's transactions every year:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-banks-launching-product-break-101215642.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-banks-launching-product-break-101215642.html</a></p>\n<p>But there's another reason to get shut of Visa/Mastercard: Trump controls them. He can order them to cut off payment processing for any individual or institution that displeases him. He's already done this to punish the International Criminal Court for issuing a genocide arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, and against a Brazilian judge for finding against the criminal dictator Jair Bolsonaro (Trump also threatened to have the judge in Bolsonaro's case assassinated). What's more, Visa/Mastercard have a record of billions (trillions?) of retail transactions taking place between non-Americans, which Trump's officials can access for surveillance purposes, or just to conduct commercial espionage to benefit American firms as a loyalty bonus for the companies that buy the most $TRUMP coins.</p>\n<p>Two days after Lagarde's radio announcement, 13 European countries announced the formation of \"EuroPA,\" an alliance that will facilitate regionwide transactions that bypass American payment processors (as well as Chinese processors like Alipay):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.europawire.eu/european-payment-leaders-sign-mou-to-create-a-sovereign-pan-european-interoperable-payments-network/eu-press-release/2026/02/02/15/34/11/168858/\">https://news.europawire.eu/european-payment-leaders-sign-mou-to-create-a-sovereign-pan-european-interoperable-payments-network/eu-press-release/2026/02/02/15/34/11/168858/</a></p>\n<p>As <em>European Business Magazine</em> points out, EuroPA is the latest in a succession of attempts to build a European payments network:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://europeanbusinessmagazine.com/business/europes-24-trillion-breakup-with-visa-and-mastercard-has-begun/\">https://europeanbusinessmagazine.com/business/europes-24-trillion-breakup-with-visa-and-mastercard-has-begun/</a></p>\n<p>There's Wero, a 2024 launch from the 16-country European Payments Initiative, which currently boasts 47m users and 1,100 banks in Belgium, France and Germany, who've spent €7.5b through the network:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-banks-launching-product-break-101215642.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-banks-launching-product-break-101215642.html</a></p>\n<p>Wero launched as a peer-to-peer payment system that used phone numbers as identifiers, but it expanded into retail at the end of last year, with several large retailers (such as Lidl) signing on to accept Wero payments.</p>\n<p>Last week, Wero announced an alliance with EuroPA, making another 130m people eligible to use the service, which now covers 72% of the EU and Norway. They're rolling out international peer-to-peer payments in 2026, and retail/ecommerce payments in 2027.</p>\n<p>These successes are all the more notable for the failures they follow, like Monnet (born 2008, died 2012). Even the EPI has been limping along since its founding, only finding a new vigor on the heels of Trump threatening EU member states with military force if he wasn't given Greenland.</p>\n<p>As <em>EBM</em> writes, earlier efforts to build a regional payment processor foundered due to infighting among national payment processors within the EU, who jealously guarded their own turf and compulsively ratfucked one another. This left Visa/Mastercard as the best (and often sole) means of conducting cross-border commerce. This produced a \"network effect\" for Visa/Mastercard: since so many Europeans had an American credit card in their wallets, European merchants had to support them; and since so many EU merchants supported Visa/Mastercard, Europeans had to carry them in their wallets.</p>\n<p>Network effects are pernicious, but not insurmountable. The EU is attacking this problem from multiple angles &#8211; not just through EuroPA, but also through the creation of the Digital Euro, a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Essentially, this would give any European who signs up an account with the ECB, the federal bank of the Eurozone. Then, using an app or a website, any two Digital Euro customers could transfer funds to one another using the bank's own ledgers, instantaneously and at zero cost.</p>\n<p><em>EBM</em> points out that there's a critical difficulty in getting EuroPA off the ground: because it is designed to be cheap to use, it doesn't offer participating banks the windfall profits that Visa/Mastercard enjoy, which might hold back investment in EuroPA infrastructure.</p>\n<p>But banks are used to making small amounts of money from a <em>lot</em> of people, and with the Digital Euro offering a \"public option,\" the private sector EuroPA system will have a competitor that pushes it to continuously improve its systems.</p>\n<p>It's true that European payment processing has been slow and halting until now, but that was when European businesses, governments and households could still pretend that the dollar &#8211; and the payment processing companies that come along with it &#8211; was a neutral platform, and not a geopolitical adversary.</p>\n<p>If there's one thing the EU has demonstrated over the past three years, it's that geopolitical threats from massive, heavily armed mad empires can break longstanding deadlocks. Remember: Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the end of Russian gas moved the EU's climate goals in ways that beggar belief: the region went from 15 years behind on its solar rollout to ten years <em>ahead</em> of schedule in just a handful of months:</p>\n<p><a

      "content": "<p>I’m now taking on consulting work. If you’re building or running a package manager, registry, or dependency tooling, I can probably help.</p>\n\n<p>Over fifteen years I’ve built <a href=\"https://libraries.io\">Libraries.io</a>, <a href=\"https://ecosyste.ms\">Ecosyste.ms</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/andrew/git-pkgs\">git-pkgs</a>, the <a href=\"https://manifest.fm\">Manifest podcast</a>, co-organised the <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/package-management/\">Package Management devroom at FOSDEM</a>, and contributed to <a href=\"https://brew.sh\">Homebrew</a>. I’ve written integrations for dozens of package managers, tracked billions of dependency relationships, and watched the same design mistakes repeat across ecosystems for a decade. That pattern recognition is what I bring to consulting engagements.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-i-can-help-with\">What I can help with</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Package manager design &amp; architecture.</strong> If you’re building a package manager, registry, or dependency resolver, or trying to fix one, I can help you avoid the mistakes that RubyGems, npm, and PyPI learned the hard way. I’ve documented the design patterns, tradeoffs, and failure modes across dozens of ecosystems in my <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/package-managers/\">cross-ecosystem package manager documentation</a>. Namespace design, version constraint semantics, lockfile formats, registry APIs, lifecycle hooks, trust models.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Software supply chain security.</strong> I’ve found and catalogued dependency confusion attacks, typosquatting campaigns, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slopsquatting\">slopsquatting</a> (a term I popularized), malicious maintainer takeovers, and protestware incidents across every major ecosystem. Trusted publishing, SBOM generation and enrichment, vulnerability scanning strategy. I know what actually works and what’s security theatre.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Package management governance.</strong> Registries aren’t just technical systems. They make political choices about naming, ownership, deletion, and dispute resolution. I contribute to <a href=\"https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/\">Alpha-Omega</a>, <a href=\"https://openssf.org/\">OpenSSF</a>, <a href=\"https://cyclonedx.org/\">CycloneDX</a>, and <a href=\"https://chaoss.community/\">CHAOSS</a> working groups. Whether you’re a registry operator designing policies, a foundation setting ecosystem standards, or a company navigating the governance landscape of your dependencies, I can help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open source ecosystem intelligence.</strong> Ecosyste.ms tracks 13+ million packages across 50+ registries, 290 million repositories, and 24 billion dependencies, the largest public dependency graph available. I can help you understand your dependency landscape, identify critical infrastructure in your supply chain, or build tooling on top of this data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Internal dependency strategy.</strong> For enterprise teams: audit your dependency practices, evaluate package manager choices, design internal registry architecture, set procurement policies, or build a supply chain security programme from scratch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open source strategy.</strong> I’ve <a href=\"https://github.com/andrew\">built and maintained</a> open source for over fifteen years: <a href=\"https://octobox.io\">octobox</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\">node-sass</a>, <a href=\"https://24pullrequests.com\">24 Pull Requests</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/splitrb/split\">Split</a>, and contributions to <a href=\"https://brew.sh\">Homebrew</a>. I’ve designed web applications that scale to millions of users. If you’re launching projects, building contributor communities, or making sustainability decisions, I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Research &amp; analysis.</strong> Guest lectures, technical reports, ecosystem comparisons, landscape surveys. I’ve presented at <a href=\"https://fosdem.org\">FOSDEM</a> and <a href=\"https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/\">NYU Secure Systems Lab</a>, spoken at the <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/posts/\">Software Mentions in OpenAlex workshop</a>, and contributed to research with <a href=\"https://www.softwareheritage.org/\">Software Heritage</a>, <a href=\"https://chaoss.community/\">CHAOSS</a>, and <a href=\"https://openssf.org/\">OpenSSF</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n\n<p>Typically an initial call to understand what you’re dealing with, then either a short engagement (a few days of focused work) or ongoing advisory. I’m flexible on structure.</p>\n\n<p>I’m based in the UK and work remotely. I’ve worked at <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://tidelift.com\">Tidelift</a>. Past clients include package registry operators, open source foundations (CHAOSS, OpenSSF), enterprise platform teams, and academic research groups (NYU, Software Heritage).</p>\n\n<p>Get in touch at <a href=\"mailto:andrew@nesbitt.io\">andrew@nesbitt.io</a> or on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@andrewnez\">Mastodon</a>.

      "content": "<img alt=\"Communities are not fungible\" src=\"https://www.joanwestenberg.com/content/images/2026/02/Gemini_Generated_Image_ml841fml841fml84.jpeg\" /><p>There&apos;s a default assumption baked into how Silicon Valley builds products, and it tracks against how urban planners redesign neighbourhoods: that communities are interchangeable, and if you &quot;lose&quot; one, you can manufacture a replacement; that the value of a group of people who share space and history can be captured in a metric and deployed at scale.</p><p>Economists have a word for assets that can be swapped one-for-one without loss of value: fungible. A dollar is fungible. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude is fungible. </p><p>...A mass of people bound together by years of shared context, inside jokes and collective memory is not.</p><p>And yet we keep treating communities as though they are.</p><p>When a platform migrates its user base to a new architecture, the implicit promise is that the community will survive the move. When a city demolishes a public housing block and offers residents vouchers for market-rate apartments across town, the implicit promise is that they&apos;ll rebuild what they had.</p><p>These promises are always broken, and the people making them either don&apos;t understand why, or they&apos;re relying on the rest of us being too blind to see it.</p><h2 id=\"what-robert-moses-got-wrong\">What Robert Moses got wrong...</h2><p>Robert Moses displaced an estimated 250,000 people over the course of his career, razing entire neighbourhoods to make way for expressways and public works projects. The defence of Moses, then and now, is utilitarian: more people benefited from the infrastructure than were harmed by its construction. The calculus assumed that the displaced residents could form equivalent communities elsewhere, and the relationships severed by a highway cutting through a block were replaceable with relationships formed in a new location. Jane Jacobs spent much of her career arguing that this was catastrophically wrong. The old neighbourhood was not a collection of individuals who happened to live near each other; it was a living organism with its own immune system and its own way of metabolising change. When Moses bulldozed it, he killed a community and scattered the remains.</p><p>Jacobs understood that the value of a community isn&apos;t in the people as discrete units. The value is in the specific, unreproducible web of relationships between them. You can move every single resident of a street to the same new street in the same new suburb and you will not get the same community, because community is a function of time and ten thousand microtransactions of reciprocity that nobody tracks and nobody can mandate.</p><h2 id=\"and-what-economists-miss\">...and what economists miss</h2><p>In a model, agents are interchangeable. Consumer A and Consumer B have different preference curves, yes, but they respond to the same incentive structures in predictable ways. Community is what you get when agents stop being interchangeable to each other. When Alice doesn&apos;t need &quot;a neighbour&quot; but needs <em>that</em> neighbour, the one who watched her kids that time, the one who knows she&apos;s allergic to peanuts. The relationship is specific, and specificity is the enemy of fungibility.</p><p>This is why so many attempts to &quot;build community&quot; from scratch end up producing something that looks like community but functions like a mailing list. The startup that launches a Discord server and calls it a community // the coworking space that holds a monthly mixer and calls it a community etc. What they&apos;ve actually built is a directory of loosely affiliated strangers who share a single contextual overlap.</p><p>That&apos;s a starting condition for community, but it&apos;s not community itself, and the difference is like the difference between a pile of lumber and a house. The raw materials are necessary but wildly insufficient.</p><h2 id=\"when-platforms-die-communities-dont-migrate\">When platforms die, communities don&apos;t migrate</h2><p>The internet has run this experiment dozens of times now, and the results are consistent. When a platform dies or degrades, its community does not simply migrate to the next platform, it fragments, and the ones who do arrive at the new place find that the social dynamics are different, the norms have shifted, and a substantial number of the people who made the old place feel like home are gone. LiveJournal&apos;s Russian acquisition scattered its English-speaking community across Dreamwidth and eventually Twitter. Each successor captured a fraction of the original user base and none of them captured the culture. The community that existed on LiveJournal in 2006 is extinct and cannot be reassembled. The specific conditions that created it, a particular moment in internet history when blogging was new and social media hadn&apos;t yet been colonised by algorithmic feeds and engagement optimisation, no longer exist.</p><p>You can see the pattern in Vine&apos;s death and the migration to Snapchat x TikTok, with Twitter&apos;s degradation and the scattering to Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon. In every case, the platform&apos;s architects // successors assumed that the product was the platform and the community was an emergent feature that would re-emerge given similar conditions. They had the relationship exactly backwards. The community was the product and the platform was the container, and when the container breaks, the product spills and evaporates, and some of it is lost forever.</p><h2 id=\"dunbars-layers-the-archaeology-of-trust\">Dunbar&apos;s layers + the archaeology of trust</h2><p>Robin Dunbar&apos;s research on social group sizes tells us that humans maintain relationships in rough layers: about five intimate relationships, fifteen close ones, fifty good friends, and a hundred and fifty meaningful acquaintances. These aren&apos;t arbitrary numbers; they mirror cognitive and emotional bandwidth constraints that are probably neurological in origin. What Dunbar&apos;s model implies about community is underappreciated. If a community is a network of overlapping Dunbar layers, then each member&apos;s experience of the community is unique, shaped by where they sit in the web. There is no &quot;the community&quot; in any objective sense. There are as many communities as there are members, each one a different cross-section of the same social graph, and this means that when you lose members, you lose entire subjective communites that existed literally nowhere else.</p><p>When a Roman town was abandoned, the physical structures decayed at different rates. Stone walls lasted centuries while textiles vanished in years. The social structure of a community decays the same way when it&apos;s disrupted. The institutional relationships, the stone walls, might survive: people will still know each other&apos;s names and professional roles. The close friendships might last a while, held together by active effort. But the ambient trust, the willingness to lend a tool without being asked or to tolerate a minor annoyance because you&apos;ve built up enough goodwill to absorb it, that&apos;s the textile, and it goes first. Once it&apos;s gone, what&apos;s left = a skeleton that looks like a community but has lost the capacity to function like one.</p><h2 id=\"why-build-a-new-one-doesnt-work\">Why &quot;build a new one&quot; doesn&apos;t work</h2><p>There&apos;s a fantasy popular among technologists and policymakers that community can be engineered. That if you identify the right variables and apply the right interventions, you can produce community on demand. This fantasy has a name in the urbanist literature: it&apos;s called &quot;new town syndrome,&quot; after the observation that Britain&apos;s postwar new towns, carefully designed with all the amenities a community could need, produced widespread anomie and social isolation in their early decades. Stevenage had shops, schools, parks and pubs. What it didn&apos;t have was history. The residents had no shared past and no slowly accumulated social capital. They had proximity without context, and proximity without context is a crowd.</p><p>The same problem pops up in every domain where someone tries to instantiate community from a blueprint. Corporate culture initiatives and neighbourhood revitalisation programs tend to optimise for the visible markers of community, events and shared spaces, while ignoring the invisible substrate that makes those markers meaningful. It&apos;s like building an elaborate birdhouse and assuming birds will come, and when they don&apos;t, the birdhouse builders typically conclude that they need a better birdhouse, rather than questioning wether birdhouses are how you get birds.</p><h2 id=\"you-cant-rerun-the-history\">You can&apos;t rerun the history</h2><p>The destruction of a community is largely irreversible. You can rebuild a building and you can replant a forest and, given enough decades, get something that resembles the original ecosystem. But a community that took twenty years to develop its particular structure of norms and mutual knowledge cannot be regrown in twenty years, because the conditions that shaped it no longer exist. The people are older, the context has changed, and the specific convergance of circumstances that brought those particular individuals together in that particular configuration at that particular time is gone. Communities are path-dependent in the strongest possible sense: their current state is a function of their entire history, and you can&apos;t rerun the history.</p><p>Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in <em>The Dispossessed</em> about the tension between a society that valued radical freedom and the structures that emerged organically to make collective life possible. Her protagonist, Shevek, discovers that even in a society designed to prevent the accumulation of power, informal hierarchies and social obligations develop on their own, shaped by nothing more than time and proximity. Le Guin understood that community structure isn&apos;t designed, it&apos;s deposited, like sediment, by the slow accumulation of interactions that nobody planned and nobody controls.</p><h2 id=\"so-what-do-we-actually-owe-existing-communities\">So what do we actually owe existing communities?</h2><p>If communities are non-fungible, if they can&apos;t be replaced once destroyed, then every decision that disrupts an existing community carries a cost that is systematically undervalued. The cost doesn&apos;t show up in a spreadsheet because it&apos;s not a line item, it&apos;s the loss of a particular, specific, irreproducible social configuration that provided its members with things that can&apos;t be purchased on the open market: ambient trust and the comfort of being known.</p><p>Displacement - whether physical or digital - is more expensive than anyone budgets for. The burden of proof should fall on the displacer, not the displaced, to demonstrate that the benefits of disruption outweigh the destruction of social capital that took years or decades to accumulate. And the glib promise of &quot;we&apos;ll build something even better&quot; should be treated with the same scepticism as a contractor who promises to replace your load-bearing wall with something decorative. It is, to be frank, bullshit. </p><p>Communities are not resources to be optimised and they&apos;re not user bases to be migrated. They&apos;re the accumulated residue of people choosing, over and over again, to remain in a relationship with each other under specific conditions that will never, ever recur in exactly the same way. </p><p>Treating them as fungible is idiotic, and we have been far too willing to let it happen unchallenged.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The most shameful thing I did in the workplace was lie to a colleague. It was about ten years ago, I was a fresh-faced intern, and in the rush to deliver something I’d skipped the step of testing my work in staging<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup>. It did not work. When deployed to production, it didn’t work there either. No big deal, in general terms: the page we were working on wasn’t yet customer-facing. But my colleague asked me over his desk whether this worked when I’d tested it, and I said something like “it sure did, no idea what happened”.</p>\n<p>I bet he forgot about it immediately. I could have just messed up the testing (for instance, by accidentally running some different code than the code I pushed), or he knew I’d probably lied, and didn’t really care. I haven’t forgotten about it. Even a decade later, I’m still ashamed to write it down.</p>\n<p>Of course I’m not ashamed about the <em>mistake</em>. I was sloppy to not test my work, but I’ve cut corners since then when I felt it was necessary, and I stand by that decision. I’m ashamed about how I handled it. But even that I understand. I was a kid, trying to learn quickly and prove I belonged in tech. The last thing I wanted to do was to dwell on the way I screwed up. If I were in my colleague’s shoes now, I’d have brushed it off too<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup>. How do I try to handle mistakes now?</p>\n<h3>Handling the emotional reaction</h3>\n<p>The most important thing is to <strong>control your emotions</strong>. If you’re anything like me, your strongest emotional reactions at work will be reserved for the times you’ve screwed up. There are usually two countervailing emotions at play here: the desire to defend yourself, find excuses, and minimize the consequences; and the desire to confess your guilt, abase yourself, and beg for forgiveness. Both of these are traps. </p>\n<p>Obviously making excuses for yourself (or flat-out denying the mistake, like I did) is bad. But going in the other direction and publicly beating yourself up about it is <em>just as bad</em>. It’s bad for a few reasons.</p>\n<p>First, you’re effectively asking the people around you to take the time and effort to reassure you, when they should be focused on the problem. Second, you’re taking yourself out of the group of people who are focused on the problem, when often you’re the best situated to figure out what to do: since it’s your mistake, you have the most context. Third, it’s just not professional. </p>\n<p>So what should you do? <strong>For the first little while, <em>do nothing</em>.</strong> Emotional reactions fade over time. Try and just ride out the initial jolt of realizing you screwed up, and the impulse to leap into action to fix it. Most of the worst reactions to screwing up happen in the immediate aftermath, so if you can simply do nothing during that period you’re already off to a good start. For me, this takes about thirty seconds. How much time you’ll need depends on you, but hopefully it’s under ten minutes. More than that and you might need to grit your teeth and work through it.</p>\n<h3>Communicate</h3>\n<p>Once you’re confident you’re under control, the next step is to <strong>tell people what happened</strong>. Typically you want to tell your manager, but depending on the problem it could also be a colleague or someone else. It’s really important here to be matter-of-fact about it, or you risk falling into the “I’m so terrible, please reassure me” trap I discussed above. You often don’t even need to explicitly say “I made a mistake”, if it’s obvious from context. Just say “I deployed a change and it’s broken X feature” (or whatever the problem is).</p>\n<p>You should do this <em>before</em> you’ve come up with a solution. It’s tempting to try to conceal your mistake and just quietly solve it. But for user-facing mistakes, concealment is impossible - somebody will raise a ticket eventually - and if you don’t communicate the issue, you risk someone else discovering it and independently raising it.</p>\n<p>In the worst case, while you’re quietly working on a fix, you’ll discover that somebody else has declared an incident. Of course, you understand the problem perfectly (since you caused it), and you know that it was caused by a bad deploy and is easily fixable. But the other people on the incident call don’t know all that. They’re thinking about the worst-case scenarios, wondering if it’s database or network-related, paging in all kinds of teams, causing all kinds of hassle. All of that could have been avoided if you had reported the issue immediately.</p>\n<p>In my experience, tech company managers will forgive mistakes<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-3\">3</a></sup>, but <strong>they won’t forgive being made to look like a fool</strong>. In particular, they won’t forgive being deprived of critical information. If they’re asked to explain the incident by their boss, and they have to flounder around because they lack the context <em>that you had all along</em>, that may harm your relationship with them for good. On the other hand, if you give them a clear summary of the problem right away, and they’re able to seem like they’re on top of things to their manager, you <em>might</em> even earn credit for the situation (despite having caused it with your initial mistake).</p>\n<h3>Accept that it’s going to hurt</h3>\n<p>However, you probably won’t earn credit. This is where I diverge from the popular software engineering wisdom that incidents are always the fault of systems, never of individuals. Of course incidents are caused by the interactions of complex systems. Everything in the universe is caused by the interactions of complex systems! But one cause in that chain is often <em>somebody screwing up</em><sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-4\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>If you’re a manager of an engineering organization, and you want a project to succeed, you probably have a mental shortlist of the engineers in your org who can reliably lead projects<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-5\">5</a></sup>. If an engineer screws up repeatedly, they’re likely to drop off that list (or at least get an asterisk next to their name).</p>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter if you had a good technical reason to make the mistake, or if it’s excusable. Managers don’t care about that stuff, because they simply don’t have the technical context to know if it’s true or if you’re just trying to talk your way out of it. What managers do have the context to evaluate is <em>results</em>, so that’s what they judge you on. That means some failures are acceptable, so long as you’ve got enough successes to balance them out.</p>\n<p>Being a strong engineer is about finding a balance between <a href=\"/being-right-a-lot\">always being right</a> and <a href=\"/taking-a-position\">taking risks</a>. If you prioritize always being right, you can probably avoid making mistakes, but you won’t be able to lead projects (since that always requires taking risks). Therefore, <strong>the optimal amount of mistakes at work is not zero.</strong> Unless you’re working in a few select industries<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-6\">6</a></sup>, you should <em>expect</em> to make mistakes now and then, otherwise you’re likely working far too slow. </p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>From memory, I think I <em>had</em> tested an earlier version of the code, but then I made some tweaks and skipped the step where I tested that it worked even with those tweaks.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Though I would have made a mental note (and if someone more senior had done this, I would have been a bit less forgiving).</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-2\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>Though they may not forget them.

Turns out, a significant fraction of that is just reducing new problems to\na vocabulary of known tricks. This is a personal, descriptive post, not a prescriptive post for you.</p>\n<p>It starts with a question posted on Ziggit. The background here is that Zig is in the process of\nremoving ambient IO capabilities. Currently, you can access program environment from anywhere via\n<span class=\"display\"><code>std.process.getEnvVarOwned</code>.</span>\nIn the next Zig version, you’ll have to thread\n<span class=\"display\"><code>std.process.Environ.Map</code></span>\nfrom main down to every routine that needs access to the environment. In this user’s case, they have\na <code>readHistory</code> function which used to look up the path to the history file in the environment, and\nthey are wondering how to best model that in the new Zig. The options on the table are:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">pub</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">fn</span><span class=\"hl-function\"> readHistory</span>(</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    io: std.Io,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    alloc: Allocator,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    file: std.Io.File,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">) ReadHistoryError<span class=\"hl-operator\">!</span><span class=\"hl-type\">void</span>;</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">pub</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">fn</span><span class=\"hl-function\"> readHistory</span>(</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    io: std.Io,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    alloc: Allocator,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    maybe_environ_map: ?<span class=\"hl-operator\">*</span>std.process.Environ.Map,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">) ReadHistoryError<span class=\"hl-operator\">!</span><span class=\"hl-type\">void</span>;</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">pub</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">fn</span><span class=\"hl-function\"> readHistory</span>(</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    io: std.Io,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    alloc: Allocator,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    maybe_absolute_path: ?[]<span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"hl-type\">u8</span>,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    maybe_environ_map: ?<span class=\"hl-operator\">*</span>std.process.Environ.Map,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">) ReadHistoryError<span class=\"hl-operator\">!</span><span class=\"hl-type\">void</span>;</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>My starting point would instead be this:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">pub</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> HistoryOptions = <span class=\"hl-keyword\">struct</span> {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    file: []<span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"hl-type\">u8</span>,</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"hl-keyword\">pub</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">fn</span><span class=\"hl-function\"> from_environment</span>(</span>\n<span class=\"line\">        environment: <span class=\"hl-operator\">*</span><span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> std.process.Environ.Map,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    ) HistoryOptions;</span>\n<span class=\"line\">};</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">pub</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">fn</span><span class=\"hl-function\"> readHistory</span>(</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    io: std.Io,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    gpa: Allocator,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    options: HistoryOptions,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">) ReadHistoryError<span class=\"hl-operator\">!</span><span class=\"hl-type\">void</span>;</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>In terms of meta programming, what I find fascinating is that this, for me, is both immediate (I\ndon’t have to think about it), but also is clearly decomposable into multiple factoids I’ve\naccumulated before. Here’s a deconstruction of what I did here, the verbal “labels” I use to think\nabout what I did, and where I had learned to do that:</p>\n<p><em>First</em>, I “raised the abstraction level” by giving <em>it</em> a name and a type (<code>HistoryOptions</code>). This\nis a rare transformation which I learned and named myself. Naming is important for my thinking and\ncommunicating process. “Let’s raise abstraction level” is a staple code review comment of mine.</p>\n<p><em>Second</em>, I avoided “midlayer mistake” by making sure that every aspect of options is\nuser-configurable. Easy to do in Zig, where all fields are public. I learned about\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/336262/\">midlayer mistake</a> from a GitHub comment by\n<a href=\"https://joshtriplett.org\">Josh Triplett</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Third</em>, I provided a “shortcut”, the\n<span class=\"display\"><code>from_environment</code></span>\nconvenience function that cuts across abstraction layers. I learned the “shortcut” aphorism from\n<a href=\"https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/detail-view.html#discussion-layering-violations-shortcuts-vs-mixins\"><em>Django Views — The Right Way</em>.</a>\nGermane to the present article, I read that post a decade after I had touched Django the last time.\nIt was useless to me on the object level. On the meta level, reading the article solidified and\n<em>named</em> several programming tricks for me. See reverberations in\n<a href=\"https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/09/28/how-to-make-a-light-bulb.html\"><em>How to Make a 💡?</em>.</a></p>\n<p><em>Fourth</em>, I instinctively renamed <code>alloc</code> to “gpa” (in opposition to “arena”), the naming I spotted\nin the Zig compiler.</p>\n<p><em>Fifth</em>, I named the configuration parameter “options”, not <code>config</code>, <code>props</code> or <code>params</code>, a naming\nscheme I learned at TigerBeetle.</p>\n<p><em>Sixth</em>, I made sure that the signature follows “positional DI” scheme. Arguments that are\ndependencies, resources with unique types are injected positionally (and have canonical names like\n<code>io</code> or <code>gpa</code>). Arguments that <em>directly</em> vary the behavior of function (as opposed to affecting\ntransitive callees) are passed by name, in the <code>Options</code> struct.</p>\n<p>To be specific, I don’t claim that my snippet is the right way to do this! I have no idea, as I\ndon’t have access to the full context. Rather, if I were <em>actually</em> solving the problem, the snippet\nabove would be my initial starting point for further iteration.</p>\n<p>Note that I also don’t explain <em>why</em> I am doing the above six things, I only name them and point at\nthe origin. Actually explaining the <em>why</em> would take a blog post of its own for every one of them.</p>\n<p>And this is I think the key property of my thought process — I have a bag of tricks, where the\ntricks are named. Inside my mind, this label points both to the actual trick (code to type),\nas well as a justification for it (in what context that would be a good trick to use).</p>\n<p>And I use these tricks all the time, literally! Just answering in passing to a forum comment makes\nme grab a handful! A lot of my knowledge is structured like a book of coding aphorisms.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Meta meta — how come I have acquired all those tricks? I read voraciously, random commits, issues,\njumping enthusiastically into rabbit holes and going on wiki trips. The key skill here is\nrecognizing an aphorism once you see it. Reading Ziggit is part of trick-acquisition routine for\nme. Having learned the trick, I remember it, where “remembering” is an act of active recall at the\nopportune moment. This recall powers “horizontal gene transfer” across domains, stealing shortcuts\nfrom Django and midlayer mistake from the kernel. Did you notice that applying “horizontal gene\ntransfer” to the domain of software engineering tacit knowledge is horizontal gene transfer? When\nentering a new domain, I actively seek out the missing tricks. I am relatively recent in Zig, but\nall the above tricks are either Zig native, or at least Zig adapted. Every once in a while, I\n“invent” a trick of my own. For example, “positional DI” is something I only verbalized last year.\nThis doesn’t mean I hadn’t been doing that before, just that the activity wasn’t mentally labeled as\na separate thing you can deliberately do. I had the idea, now I also have an aphorism.</p>",

This goes beyond automated tests - we need artifacts that show their progress and help us see exactly what the agent-produced software is able to do.

A big part of that is proving to ourselves and to other people that the code we are responsible for behaves as expected.</p>\n<p>This becomes even more important - and challenging - as we embrace coding agents as a core part of our software development process.</p>\n<p>The more code we churn out with agents, the more valuable tools are that reduce the amount of manual QA time we need to spend.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting things about <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/\">the StrongDM software factory model</a> is how they ensure that their software is well tested and delivers value despite their policy that \"code must not be reviewed by humans\". Part of their solution involves expensive swarms of QA agents running through \"scenarios\" to exercise their software. It's fascinating, but I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on QA robots if I can avoid it!</p>\n<p>I need tools that allow agents to clearly demonstrate their work to me, while minimizing the opportunities for them to cheat about what they've done.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"showboat-agents-build-documents-to-demo-their-work\">Showboat: Agents build documents to demo their work</h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat\">Showboat</a></strong> is the tool I built to help agents demonstrate their work to me.</p>\n<p>It's a CLI tool (a Go binary, optionally <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/4/distributing-go-binaries/\">wrapped in Python</a> to make it easier to install) that helps an agent construct a Markdown document demonstrating exactly what their newly developed code can do.</p>\n<p>It's not designed for humans to run, but here's how you would run it anyway:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>showboat init demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>How to use curl and jq<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat note demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Here's how to use curl and jq together.<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\nshowboat <span class=\"pl-c1\">exec</span> demo.md bash <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat note demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat image demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png &amp;&amp; echo curl-logo.png<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Here's what the result looks like if you open it up in VS Code and preview the Markdown:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot showing a Markdown file &quot;demo.md&quot; side-by-side with its rendered preview. The Markdown source (left) shows: &quot;# How to use curl and jq&quot;, italic timestamp &quot;2026-02-10T01:12:30Z&quot;, prose &quot;Here's how to use curl and jq together.&quot;, a bash code block with &quot;curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description&quot;, output block showing '&quot;CLI tool for interacting with the web&quot;', text &quot;And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:&quot;, a bash {image} code block with &quot;curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png &amp;&amp; echo curl-logo.png&quot;, and a Markdown image reference &quot;2056e48f-2026-02-10&quot;. The rendered preview (right) displays the formatted heading, timestamp, prose, styled code blocks, and the curl logo image in dark teal showing &quot;curl://&quot; with circuit-style design elements.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/curl-demo.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Here's that <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/fb0b24696ed8dd91314fe41f4c453563#file-demo-md\">demo.md file in a Gist</a>.</p>\n<p>So a sequence of <code>showboat init</code>, <code>showboat note</code>, <code>showboat exec</code> and <code>showboat image</code> commands constructs a Markdown document one section at a time, with the output of those <code>exec</code> commands automatically added to the document directly following the commands that were run.</p>\n<p>The <code>image</code> command is a little special - it looks for a file path to an image in the output of the command and copies that image to the current folder and references it in the file.</p>\n<p>That's basically the whole thing! There's a <code>pop</code> command to remove the most recently added section if something goes wrong, a <code>verify</code> command to re-run the document and check nothing has changed (I'm not entirely convinced by the design of that one) and a <code>extract</code> command that reverse-engineers the CLI commands that were used to create the document.</p>\n<p>It's pretty simple - just 172 lines of Go.</p>\n<p>I packaged it up with my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/go-to-wheel\">go-to-wheel</a> tool which means you can run it without even installing it first like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx showboat --help</pre></div>\n<p>That <code>--help</code> command is really important: it's designed to provide a coding agent with <em>everything it needs to know</em> in order to use the tool. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/blob/main/help.txt\">that help text in full</a>.</p>\n<p>This means you can pop open Claude Code and tell it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run \"uvx showboat --help\" and then use showboat to create a demo.md document describing the feature you just built</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's it! The <code>--help</code> text acts <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/\">a bit like a Skill</a>. Your agent can read the help text and use every feature of Showboat to create a document that demonstrates whatever it is you need demonstrated.</p>\n<p>Here's a fun trick: if you set Claude off to build a Showboat document you can pop that open in VS Code and watch the preview pane update in real time as the agent runs through the demo. It's a bit like having your coworker talk you through their latest work in a screensharing session.</p>\n<p>And finally, some examples. Here are documents I had Claude create using Showboat to help demonstrate features I was working on in other projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/shot-scraper/README.md\">shot-scraper: A Comprehensive Demo</a> runs through the full suite of features of my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper</a> browser automation tool, mainly to exercise the <code>showboat image</code> command.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/cli.md\">sqlite-history-json CLI demo</a> demonstrates the CLI feature I added to my new <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json\">sqlite-history-json</a> Python library.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/row-state-sql.md\">row-state-sql CLI Demo</a> shows a new <code>row-state-sql</code> command I added to that same project.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/change-grouping.md\">Change grouping with Notes</a> demonstrates another feature where groups of changes within the same transaction can have a note attached to them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/libkrun-go-cli-tool/demo.md\">krunsh: Pipe Shell Commands to an Ephemeral libkrun MicroVM</a> is a particularly convoluted example where I managed to get Claude Code for web to run a libkrun microVM inside a QEMU emulated Linux environment inside the Claude gVisor sandbox.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've now used Showboat often enough that I've convinced myself of its utility.</p>\n<p>(I've also seen agents cheat! Since the demo file is Markdown the agent will sometimes edit that file directly rather than using Showboat, which could result in command outputs that don't reflect what actually happened. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/issues/12\">an issue about that</a>.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"rodney-cli-browser-automation-designed-to-work-with-showboat\">Rodney: CLI browser automation designed to work with Showboat</h4>\n<p>Many of the projects I work on involve web interfaces. Agents often build entirely new pages for these, and I want to see those represented in the demos.</p>\n<p>Showboat's image feature was designed to allow agents to capture screenshots as part of their demos, originally using my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper tool</a> or <a href=\"https://www.playwright.dev\">Playwright</a>.</p>\n<p>The Showboat format benefits from CLI utilities. I went looking for good options for managing a multi-turn browser session from a CLI and came up short, so I decided to try building something new.</p>\n<p>Claude Opus 4.6 pointed me to the <a href=\"https://github.com/go-rod/rod\">Rod</a> Go library for interacting with the Chrome DevTools protocol. It's fantastic - it provides a comprehensive wrapper across basically everything you can do with automated Chrome, all in a self-contained library that compiles to a few MBs.</p>\n<p>All Rod was missing was a CLI.</p>\n<p>I built the first version <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/go-rod-cli/README.md\">as an asynchronous report prototype</a>, which convinced me it was worth spinning out into its own project.</p>\n<p>I called it Rodney as a nod to the Rod library it builds on and a reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Fools_and_Horses\">Only Fools and Horses</a> - and because the package name was available on PyPI.</p>\n<p>You can run Rodney using <code>uvx rodney</code> or install it like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv tool install rodney</pre></div>\n<p>(Or grab a Go binary <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/releases/\">from the releases page</a>.)</p>\n<p>Here's a simple example session:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>rodney start <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> starts Chrome in the background</span>\nrodney open https://datasette.io/\nrodney js <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Array.from(document.links).map(el =&gt; el.href).slice(0, 5)<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nrodney click <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>a[href=\"/for\"]<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nrodney js location.href\nrodney js document.title\nrodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\nrodney stop</pre></div>\n<p>Here's what that looks like in the terminal:</p>\n<p><img alt=\";~ % rodney start\nChrome started (PID 91462)\nDebug URL: ws://127.0.0.1:64623/devtools/browser/cac6988e-8153-483b-80b9-1b75c611868d\n~ % rodney open https://datasette.io/\nDatasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data\n~ % rodney js 'Array.from(document.links).map(el =&gt; el.href).slice(0, 5)'\n[\n&quot;https://datasette.io/for&quot;,\n&quot;https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/tutorials&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/examples&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/plugins&quot;\n]\n~ % rodney click 'a[href=&quot;/for&quot;]'\nClicked\n~ % rodney js location.href\nhttps://datasette.io/for\n~ % rodney js document.title\nUse cases for Datasette\n~ % rodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\ndatasette-for-page.png\n~ % rodney stop\nChrome stopped\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/rodney-demo.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>As with Showboat, this tool is not designed to be used by humans! The goal is for coding agents to be able to run <code>rodney --help</code> and see everything they need to know to start using the tool. You can see <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/help.txt\">that help output</a> in the GitHub repo.</p>\n<p>Here are three demonstrations of Rodney that I created using Showboat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/rodney/README.md\">Rodney's original feature set</a>, including screenshots of pages and executing JavaScript.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/notes/accessibility-features/README.md\">Rodney's new accessibility testing features</a>, built during development of those features to show what they could do.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/datasette-database-page-accessibility-audit/README.md\">Using those features to run a basic accessibility audit of a page</a>. I was impressed at how well Claude Opus 4.6 responded to the prompt \"Use showboat and rodney to perform an accessibility audit of <a href=\"https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures\">https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures</a>\" - <a href=\"https://gisthost.github.io/?dce6b2680db4b05c04469ed8f251eb34/index.html\">transcript here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"test-driven-development-helps-but-we-still-need-manual-testing\">Test-driven development helps, but we still need manual testing</h4>\n<p>After being a career-long skeptic of the test-first, maximum test coverage school of software development (I like <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/#tests\">tests included</a> development instead) I've recently come around to test-first processes as a way to force agents to write only the code that's necessary to solve the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>Many of my Python coding agent sessions start the same way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run the existing tests with \"uv run pytest\". Build using red/green TDD.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Telling the agents how to run the tests doubles as an indicator that tests on this project exist and matter. Agents will read existing tests before writing their own so having a clean test suite with good patterns makes it more likely they'll write good tests of their own.</p>\n<p>The frontier models all understand that \"red/green TDD\" means they should write the test first, run it and watch it fail and then write the code to make it pass - it's a convenient shortcut.</p>\n<p>I find this greatly increases the quality of the code and the likelihood that the agent will produce the right thing with the smallest amount of prompts to guide it.</p>\n<p>But anyone who's worked with tests will know that just because the automated tests pass doesn't mean the software actually works! That’s the motivation behind Showboat and Rodney - I never trust any feature until I’ve seen it running with my own eye.</p>\n<p>Before building Showboat I'd often add a “manual” testing step to my agent sessions, something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Once the tests pass, start a development server and exercise the new feature using curl</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"i-built-both-of-these-tools-on-my-phone\">I built both of these tools on my phone</h4>\n<p>Both Showboat and Rodney started life as Claude Code for web projects created via the Claude iPhone app. Most of the ongoing feature work for them happened in the same way.</p>\n<p>I'm still a little startled at how much of my coding work I get done on my phone now, but I'd estimate that the majority of code I ship to GitHub these days was written for me by coding agents driven via that iPhone app.</p>\n<p>I initially designed these two tools for use in asynchronous coding agent environments like Claude Code for the web.

A fellow commissioner and I decided to take a long lunchtime walk along the coast. As we chatted, we realized we had both worked on several of the same very classified programs. His involvement was in acquisition and finance, while mine was more deeply connected to the engineering development of the project and hands-on with the operators on site.</span></p>\n<p><b>We Got Our Advanced Technology From Aliens<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we both were discreet about not talking about specifics, we recognized the projects we had worked on. So you can imagine my surprise when he turned to me and casually said, &#8220;You know this technology came from aliens.&#8221; I laughed, thinking that obviously he must be joking. But as we continued walking he continued on, claiming, “You know the equipment you worked on and stuff that followed came from our secret alien investigation site at <a href=\"https://www.military.com/off-duty/2020/12/18/6-urban-legends-about-wright-patterson-air-force-base.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wright Patterson Air Force Base</a>. All we did was reverse engineer Alien technology.” This time I stopped in my tracks and looked at him to see if he was smiling. I was puzzled as he looked dead serious. He explained that there was no possible way we could be doing what we were doing using existing technology. Before I changed the subject I asked him how he knew this, he replied with absolute sincerity, “I was head of acquisition on the program. I was briefed on the project. That&#8217;s what they told us and they swore us to secrecy.“<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33503\" height=\"143\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?resize=300%2C143&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"300\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really didn&#8217;t know how to process this. He was really a smart and level-headed guy. In fact he was the mayor at the time of Rancho Palos Verde. It took me a mile or two into our walk to rethink everything I knew about the project (even then it had been in decades past), including having sat with a few of the engineers (some strange, but not aliens) as they were designing the system (with me trying to keep up with the revised blueprints in document control), and then watching the system being built and assembled. While it had required incredibly creative engineering, and applying technology on a scale so massive no commercial company could afford it, this system was built by smart people with no aliens involved. But he was equally convinced they were. Over our time together on the commission we took more walks, had lots more to talk about, but we never broached the subject again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every once in a while, for the next few years, I puzzled on how he could have been so sure of something that I was sure was completely wrong.</span></p>\n<p><b>We Did Tell Them It Was Aliens<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward 15 years, and my world view of that conversation was upended when I read in the </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wall Street Journal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Department of Defense had been running a disinformation campaign, briefing finance and acquisition people that the technology for these classified programs </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> coming from aliens. (Take a minute and </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">read the article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of a sudden our coast-side conversation from a decade and a half ago made sense to me. Most of our most compartmentalized programs have different levels of what was called &#8220;</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need to know</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&#8221; I never paid much attention as I was </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_access_program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">read all the way into</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the technical and operational details of these programs. I vaguely knew that others got fewer details, but as I was just discovering, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">others had received active disinformation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In a few cases, security officers were even using fake photos and documents to create the Alien cover-story for secret-weapons programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It turns out my fellow commissioner had been briefed by the U.S. government that it was Aliens, and he went to his grave believing it so. </span></p>\n<p><b>Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s interesting is what happened after the news came out that the Alien story was government disinformation. A large percentage of people who were briefed, now &#8220;doubled down&#8221; and believed “we got the technology from Aliens” even more strongly &#8211; believing the new information itself was a coverup. Many dismissed the facts by prioritizing how they felt over reality, something we often see in political or religious contexts.

These top secret projects gave rise to decades of UFO sightings. Instead of acknowledging these sightings were from classified military projects the Department of Defense issued cover stories (&#8220;you saw weather balloons&#8221;) that weren&#8217;t believable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Governments and companies have always kept secrets and used misinformation and manipulation. However, things stay secret way too long &#8211; for many reasons &#8211; some reasonable (we’re still using the same methods &#8211; reconnaissance technology, tradecraft, or, it would harm people still alive &#8211; retired spies, etc) or not so reasonable (we broke U.S. or international laws &#8211; </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COINTELPRO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or it would embarrass us or our allies &#8211; Kennedy assassination, or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_files\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Epstein files</a>).  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secrecy increases the odds of conspiracy beliefs. Because evidence can’t be checked, contradictions can’t be audited, a government “cover-up” becomes a plausible explanation. People don’t tolerate “I don’t know” for long when stakes are high (stolen elections, identity, national crises, the meaning of life, or what happens when we die). That vacuum gets filled by the most emotionally satisfying model: a hidden “higher power” concealing information and controlling events.</span></p>\n<p><b>Summary<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as social media replaced traditional news sources, AI-driven summaries of current events are likely to replace our understanding of the world around us. What happens to trust when AI manipulates human&#8217;s tendency to embrace conspiracy theories? Who will define the truth in the brave new world?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And by the way, I’m still pretty sure we didn&#8217;t get it from Aliens.</span></p>",

This is a wryly funny and cosily charming book about council funerals.</p>\n\n<p>Evie King conducts Section 46 funerals under the Public Health Act. If you die and there's no one else around who is able to arrange your funeral, the local council steps in. This could be a coldly bureaucratic process with no wiggle room for anything other than perfunctory sympathy. But humans are going to human. Why <em>wouldn't</em> you put some effort in to making people feel cherished in death?</p>\n\n<p>In many ways, this is what Cameron's \"Big Society\" should have been about. Giving empathetic and passionate people a chance to serve their community and enrich all our lives. And, I guess, deaths. But austerity makes it hard to stay motivated when you're doing multiple people's jobs for a fraction of the pay.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't to say King is a whinger - quite the opposite - but she is clearly frustrated that she cannot do more. People who interact with the state are rarely in a good emotional or financial place. Those interacting with Section 46 deserve more support than is available to them. What King does is marvellous - but necessarily limited. In effect, it is a series of short stories each taking a look at a different death and how she tried as hard as possible to make the funeral process as painless and uplifting as it can be.</p>\n\n<p>The book is, naturally, a little upsetting in places. It isn't so much that people die; it is how society reacts which causes such emotional turmoil. Why are people sometimes abandoned? Why do reconciliations never happen until it is too late? How do we deal with trauma?</p>\n\n<p>It is an excellent book but it is rather annoying that the publisher, <a href=\"https://www.mirrorbooks.co.uk/\">Mirror Books</a> only makes the eBook available via Amazon. There's no other way to read it - not even via a library! I resorted to borrowing the audiobook. This was the first audiobook I've ever listened to - and it was a rather curious experience. The author's voice was slightly hesitant at first, but gradually became more passionate and evocative. It was wonderful to hear her tell her story directly.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Whilst I was implementing a <a href=\"https://github.com/git-pkgs/git-pkgs/pull/98\">vendor command in git-pkgs</a>, I noticed that not many package manager clients have native vendoring commands. Go has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">go mod vendor</code>, Cargo has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cargo vendor</code>, and Bundler has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bundle cache</code>. That’s most of the first-class support I could find, which surprised me for something that used to be the dominant way to manage dependencies. So I went looking for what happened.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vendoring-under-svn\">Vendoring under SVN</h3>\n\n<p>Before lockfiles and registries, if you wanted reproducible builds you checked your dependencies into source control. The alternative was hoping the internet served you the same bytes tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Under Subversion this worked fine. SVN checkouts only pull the current revision of the directories you ask for, leaving everything else on the server. You never download previous versions of vendored files, so a dependency updated twenty times costs you the same as one updated once. A 200MB vendor directory doesn’t slow you down if you never check it out, and CI can do the same. Most developers on a project never touched <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> directly, and the cost of carrying all that third-party code was invisible to everyone who wasn’t actively updating it.</p>\n\n<p>Rails formalized the convention with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> for third-party code and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lib/</code> for your own. You could even freeze the Rails framework itself into your vendor directory with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rake rails:freeze:gems</code>. Chris Wanstrath’s “Vendor Everything” post on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/2007/http://errtheblog.com/posts/50-vendor-everything\">err the blog</a> in 2007 named the philosophy, though the practice traces back to 2006. Ryan McGeary updated it for the Bundler era in 2011 with <a href=\"http://ryan.mcgeary.org/2011/02/09/vendor-everything-still-applies/\">“Vendor Everything Still Applies”</a>: “Storage is cheap. You’ll thank me later when your deployments run smoothly.” Bundler’s arrival was effectively Rails admitting that physical vendoring was a dead end: pin versions in a lockfile instead. Composer made <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> its default install target. The name stuck because it was already familiar.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"git-clone\">git clone</h3>\n\n<p>Git clones the entire repository history by default. Every developer, every CI run, gets everything. A vendored dependency updated twenty times means twenty snapshots of its source tree in your .git directory, forever. Shallow clones and partial clones help, but as I wrote in <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/24/package-managers-keep-using-git-as-a-database/\">package managers keep using git as a database</a>, they’re workarounds for a problem SVN never had.</p>\n\n<p>The weight became visible in ways it hadn’t been before: code search indexed everything in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code>. GitHub’s language statistics counted vendored code unless you added <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">linguist-vendored</code> to .gitattributes. Pull requests touching <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> generated walls of diff noise. The developer experience of working with a vendored codebase went from tolerable to actively painful.</p>\n\n<p>Security tooling piled on: GitHub’s dependency graph, Dependabot, and similar tools parse lockfiles and manifests to find vulnerable dependencies. Vendored code is invisible to them unless you go out of your way to make it discoverable. The entire vulnerability scanning ecosystem assumed lockfiles won and built around that assumption, which created a feedback loop: the more teams relied on automated scanning, the more vendoring looked like a liability rather than a safety net.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lockfiles-and-registries\">Lockfiles and registries</h3>\n\n<p>Bundler shipped Gemfile.lock in 2010, one of the first lockfiles to pin exact dependency versions with enough information to reproduce an install. But the ecosystem where vendoring arguments ran hottest didn’t have one for years. npm launched in 2010 too, and you’d specify <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">^1.2.0</code> in package.json and get whatever the registry served that day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2016/10/11/web/yarn-a-new-package-manager-for-javascript/\">Yarn launched</a> in October 2016 with yarn.lock and content hashes from day one. npm followed with <a href=\"https://blog.npmjs.org/post/161081169345/v500\">package-lock.json in npm 5.0</a> in May 2017. Once lockfiles recorded exact versions and integrity hashes (I covered the design choices in <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/17/lockfile-format-design-and-tradeoffs/\">lockfile format design and tradeoffs</a>), you got reproducible builds without storing the code. The lockfile records what to fetch, the registry serves it, and the hash proves nothing changed in transit.</p>\n\n<p>Lockfiles spread to every major ecosystem. The <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/11/15/package-manager-timeline\">package manager timeline</a> shows them arriving in waves: Bundler in 2010, Cargo.lock with Rust in 2015, Yarn and npm in 2016-2017, pipenv and Poetry bringing lockfiles to Python.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"left-pad\">left-pad</h3>\n\n<p>In March 2016, a developer <a href=\"https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm\">unpublished the 11-line left-pad package</a> from npm and broke builds across the ecosystem, including React and Babel. The immediate reaction was a rush back toward vendoring. If the registry can just delete packages, how can you trust it?</p>\n\n<p>The long-term response went the other way: npm <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish\">tightened its unpublish policy</a>. Lockfiles with content hashes meant even a re-uploaded package with different code would be caught. And enterprise proxy caches like <a href=\"https://jfrog.com/artifactory/\">Artifactory</a> filled the remaining availability gap: a local mirror that your builds pull from, still serving packages even when the upstream registry goes down or a maintainer rage-quits. The availability guarantee of vendoring, without anything in your git history.</p>\n\n<p>left-pad is sometimes framed as vindication for vendoring. I think it was the moment the industry decided to <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/22/package-registries-are-governance-as-a-service/\">fix registry governance</a> rather than abandon registries altogether.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-c-shaped-hole\">The C-shaped hole</h3>\n\n<p>C never went through this transition because it never had the prerequisites: no dominant language package manager, no central registry that everyone publishes to, and no lockfile format. A lockfile is just a pointer to something in a registry, and if there’s no reliable registry to point to, you have to bring the code with you.</p>\n\n<p>As I wrote in <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/27/the-c-shaped-hole-in-package-management/\">The C-Shaped Hole in Package Management</a>, developers are still dropping .c and .h files into source trees the way they have since the 1970s. Libraries like SQLite and stb are distributed as single files specifically to make this easy. Conan and vcpkg exist now, but neither has the cultural ubiquity that would make vendoring unnecessary. Without a registry everyone agrees on, vendoring in C remains the path of least resistance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"go-and-the-google-problem\">Go and the Google problem</h3>\n\n<p>Go was one of the last major languages to move past vendoring, and the reason traces straight back to Google. Go was designed at Google, by Google engineers, for Google’s development workflow. Google runs a monorepo and prizes hermetic builds: every build must be fully reproducible from what’s in the repository, with zero outside dependencies. Vendoring is how you get hermeticity, so all third-party code lives in the repository alongside first-party code, maintained by dedicated teams and managed by advanced tooling.</p>\n\n<p>So Go shipped without a real package manager. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">go get</code> fetched the latest commit from a repository with no versions, no lockfiles, and no registry. Russ Cox later acknowledged this in his <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/vgo\">Go += Package Versioning</a> series: “It was clear in the very first discussions of goinstall [in 2010] that we needed to do something about versioning. Unfortunately, it was not clear… exactly what to do.” They didn’t experience the pain internally because Google’s monorepo doesn’t need versions, since everything builds at head.</p>\n\n<p>The community filled the gap with godep, glide, and dep, and all of them used a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> directory. <a href=\"https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25719-go15vendor.md\">Go 1.5 formalized vendoring support</a> in 2015, blessing what everyone was already doing. For five years, vendoring was the official answer.</p>\n\n<p>Go modules arrived in Go 1.11 in 2018 with go.mod and go.sum. But the piece that actually replaced vendoring came later: the module proxy at proxy.golang.org and the checksum database at sum.golang.org. Russ Cox argued in <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/vgo-module\">Defining Go Modules</a> that the proxy made vendor directories “almost entirely redundant.” The proxy caches modules indefinitely and the sum database verifies integrity, so together they provide monorepo-level guarantees to people who don’t have a monorepo: if the source disappears, the proxy still has it; if the code changes, the checksum catches it.</p>\n\n<p>As of this writing, Kubernetes still vendors its dependencies, a large project with the discipline to keep vendored code current, the same discipline Google has in its monorepo. Most teams don’t have that discipline, and for them, vendored dependencies go stale quietly until someone discovers a CVE six versions behind.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"nix-and-guix\">Nix and Guix</h3>\n\n<p>Nix and Guix take the idea in a different direction. They do something that looks a lot like vendoring but with different mechanics, and they go further than anyone else ever did. Nix doesn’t just vendor your libraries but the entire build closure: the library, the compiler that built it, the linker, the kernel headers. Every input gets copied into a content-addressed store, pinned by hash. A Nix <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">flake.lock</code> file pins exact input revisions and gets committed to the repository, while <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nix build</code> fetches everything into <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/nix/store</code> where it lives alongside every other version of every other package, isolated and immutable.</p>\n\n<p>It’s hermeticity without the monorepo. You get offline builds, exact reproducibility, and a verifiable record of what went into your project. But the code lives in the Nix store rather than your repository, so you don’t pay the git history cost that made traditional vendoring painful. The tradeoff is complexity: you need to buy into Nix’s model of the world, and the learning curve is steep.</p>\n\n<p>If the vendoring instinct was always about control (knowing exactly what code you’re running, not depending on a registry being up and honest), then Nix is where that instinct ended up for the people who took it the most seriously.</p>",

What can the opposition party do without majorities in either house? Well, they could start by refusing to continue to fund ICE, a masked thug snatch/murder squad that roams our streets, killing with impunity:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273\">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273</a></p>\n<p>That's table stakes. What would a <em>real</em> political response to fascism look like? Again, it wouldn't stop with banning masks for ICE goons, or even requiring them to wear QR codes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345\">https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345</a></p>\n<p>Though it should be noted that ICE hates this idea, and that ICE agents wear masks because they fear consequences for their sadistic criminality:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/0LNh8\">https://archive.is/0LNh8</a></p>\n<p>This despite the fact that the (criminally culpable) Vice President has assured them that they have absolute impunity, no matter who they kill:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis\">https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis</a></p>\n<p>The fact that ICE agents worry about consequences despite Vance's assurances suggests ways that Dems could \"meet the moment.\"</p>\n<p>I think Dems should start a Nuremberg Caucus, named for the Nazi war-crimes trials that followed from the defeat of German fascists and the death of their leader:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials</a></p>\n<p>What would this caucus do? Well, it could have a public website where it assembled and organized the evidence for the trials that the Democrats could promise to bring after the Trump regime falls. Each fresh outrage, each statement, each video-clip &#8211; whether of Trump officials or of his shock-troops &#8211; could be neatly slotted in, given an exhibit number, and annotated with the criminal and civil violations captured in the evidence.</p>\n<p>The caucus could publish dates these trials will be held on &#8211; following from Jan 20, 2029 &#8211; and even which courtrooms each official, high and low, will be tried in. These dates could be changed as new crimes emerge, making sure the most egregious offenses are always at the top of the agenda. Each trial would have a witness list.</p>\n<p>The Nuremberg Caucus could vow to repurpose ICE's $75b budget to pursue Trump's crimes, from corruption to civil rights violations to labor violations to environmental violations. It could announce its intent to fully fund the FTC and DoJ Antitrust Division to undertake scrutiny of all mergers approved under Trump, and put corporations on notice that they should expect lengthy, probing inquiries into any mergers they undertake between now and the fall of Trumpism. Who knows, perhaps some shareholders will demand that management hold off on mergers in anticipation of this lookback scrutiny, and if not, perhaps they will sue executives after the FTC and DoJ go to work.</p>\n<p>While they're at it, the Nuremberg Caucus could publish a plan to hire thousands of <em>IRS</em> agents (paid for by taxing billionaires and zeroing out ICE's budget) who will focus exclusively on the ultra-wealthy and especially any supernormal wealth gains coinciding with the second Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>Money talks. ICE agents are signing up with the promise of $50k hiring bonuses and $60k in student debt cancellation. That's peanuts. The Nuremberg Caucus could announce a Crimestoppers-style program with $1m bounties for any ICE officer who a) is themselves innocent of any human rights violations, and; b) provides evidence leading to the conviction of another ICE officer for committing human rights violations. That would certainly improve morale for (some) ICE officers.</p>\n<p>Critics of this plan will say that this will force Trump officials to try to steal the next election in order to avoid consequences for their actions. This is certainly true: confidence in a \"peaceful transfer of power\" is the bedrock of any kind of fair election.</p>\n<p>But this bunch have already <em>repeatedly</em> signaled that they intend to steal the midterms and the next general election:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html\">https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html</a></p>\n<p>ICE agents are straight up telling people that ICE is on the streets to arrest people in Democratic-leaning states (\"The more people that you lose in Minnesota, you then lose a voting right to stay blue\"):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/\">https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/</a></p>\n<p>The only path to fair elections &#8211; and saving America &#8211; lies through mobilizing and energizing hundreds of millions of Americans. They are ready. They are <em>begging</em> for leadership. They want an electoral <em>choice</em>, something better than a return to the pre-Trump status quo. If you want giant crowds at every polling place, rising up against ICE and DHS voter-suppression, then you have to promise people that their vote will <em>mean</em> something.</p>\n<p>Dems have to pick a side. That means being against anyone who is for fascism &#8211; including other Dems. The Nuremberg Caucus should denounce the disgusting child abuse perpetrated by the Trump regime:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children\">https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children</a></p>\n<p>But they should also denounce Democrats who vote to fund that abuse:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html\">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html</a></p>\n<p>The people of Minneapolis (and elsewhere) have repeatedly proven that we outnumber fascists by a huge margin.
