The earliest document from 2021 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The specific public benefit that the Corporation will promote is to responsibly develop and maintain advanced Al for the cultural, social and technological improvement of humanity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every subsequent document up to 2024 uses an updated version which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The specific public benefit that the Corporation will promote is to responsibly develop and maintain advanced AI for the long term benefit of humanity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/anthropic\">anthropic</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a></p>"
