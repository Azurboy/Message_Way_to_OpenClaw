  "content": "<p>I'm a very heavy user of <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web\">Claude Code on the web</a>, Anthropic's excellent but poorly named cloud version of Claude Code where everything runs in a container environment managed by them, greatly reducing the risk of anything bad happening to a computer I care about.</p>\n<p>I don't use the web interface at all (hence my dislike of the name) - I access it exclusively through their native iPhone and Mac desktop apps.</p>\n<p>Something I particularly appreciate about the desktop app is that it lets you see images that Claude is \"viewing\" via its <code>Read /path/to/image</code> tool. Here's what that looks like:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of a Claude Code session in Claude Desktop. Claude says: The debug page looks good - all items listed with titles and descriptions. Now let me check the nav\nmenu -  Analyzed menu image file - Bash uvx rodney open &quot;http://localhost:8765/&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; uvx rodney click &quot;details.nav-menu summary&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;% sleep 0.5 &amp;&amp; uvx rodney screenshot /tmp/menu.png 2&gt;&amp;1 Output reads: Datasette: test, Clicked, /tmp/menu.png - then it says Read /tmp/menu.png and reveals a screenshot of the Datasette interface with the nav menu open, showing only &quot;Debug&quot; and &quot;Log out&quot; options. Claude continues: The menu now has just &quot;Debug&quot; and “Log out&quot; — much cleaner. Both pages look good. Let me clean up the server and run the remaining tests.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/rodney-claude-desktop.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>This means you can get a visual preview of what it's working on while it's working, without waiting for it to push code to GitHub for you to try out yourself later on.</p>\n<p>The prompt I used to trigger the above screenshot was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run \"uvx rodney --help\" and then use Rodney to manually test the new pages and menu - look at screenshots from it and check you think they look OK</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I designed <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/10/showboat-and-rodney/#rodney-cli-browser-automation-designed-to-work-with-showboat\">Rodney</a> to have <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/help.txt\">--help output</a> that provides everything a coding agent needs to know in order to use the tool.</p>\n<p>The Claude iPhone app doesn't display opened images yet, so I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonw/status/2023432616066879606\">requested it as a feature</a> just now in a thread on Twitter.</p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/anthropic\">anthropic</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude\">claude</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code\">claude-code</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/async-coding-agents\">async-coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/rodney\">rodney</a></p>"
