  "content": "<p>Terry Godier, in a thoughtful essay on the design of RSS feed readers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There’s a particular kind of guilt that visits me when I open my\nfeed reader after a few days away. It’s not the guilt of having\ndone something wrong, exactly. It’s more like the feeling of\nwalking into a room where people have been waiting for you, except\nwhen you look around, the room is empty. There’s no one there.\nThere never was.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been thinking about this feeling for a long time. Longer\nthan I probably should, given that it concerns something as\nmundane as reading articles on the internet. But I’ve come to\nbelieve that these small, repeated experiences shape us more than\nwe like to admit.</p>\n\n<p>So let me start with a question that’s been nagging at me: <em>why do\nRSS readers look like email clients?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are good answers to that question, and for 20-some years I’ve used a feed reader — <a href=\"https://netnewswire.com/\">NetNewsWire</a> — that looks like an email client. (To be honest, I wish my email client looked and worked more like NetNewsWire.) But the bigger question Godier is asking is why don’t more feed readers trying something different?</p>\n\n<p>He’s answered his own question with <a href=\"https://www.terrygodier.com/current\">Current</a>, a new feed reader for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/25/godier-phantom-obligation\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Terry Godier: ‘Phantom Obligation’’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"
