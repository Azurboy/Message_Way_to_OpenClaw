Here's <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/\">detailed analysis from Bloomberg in September</a> reporting \"Wholesale electricity costs as much as 267% more than it did five years ago in areas near data centers\".</p>\n<p>Anthropic appear to be taking on this aspect of the problem directly, promising to cover 100% of necessary grid upgrade costs and also saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We will work to bring net-new power generation online to match our data centers’ electricity needs. Where new generation isn’t online, we’ll work with utilities and external experts to estimate and cover demand-driven price effects from our data centers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I look forward to genuine energy industry experts picking this apart to judge if it will actually have the claimed impact on consumers.</p>\n<p>As always, I remain frustrated at the refusal of the major AI labs to fully quantify their energy usage. The best data we've had on this still comes from Mistral's report <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/22/mistral-environmental-standard/\">last July</a> and even that lacked key data such as the breakdown between energy usage for training vs inference.\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://x.com/anthropicai/status/2021694494215901314\">@anthropicai</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/anthropic\">anthropic</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-energy-usage\">ai-energy-usage</a></p>"
