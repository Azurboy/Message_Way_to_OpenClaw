[...]</p>\n<p>At a high level, I see Codex as three parts working together:</p>\n<p><em>Codex = Model + Harness + Surfaces</em> [...]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model + Harness = the Agent</li>\n<li>Surfaces = how you interact with the Agent</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He defines the harness as \"the collection of instructions and tools\", which is notably open source and lives in the <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/codex\">openai/codex</a> repository.</p>\n<p>Gabriel also provides the first acknowledgment I've seen from an OpenAI insider that the Codex model family are directly trained for the Codex harness:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Codex models are trained in the presence of the harness. Tool use, execution loops, compaction, and iterative verification aren’t bolted on behaviors — they’re part of how the model learns to operate. The harness, in turn, is shaped around how the model plans, invokes tools, and recovers from failure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/definitions\">definitions</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/openai\">openai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/codex-cli\">codex-cli</a></p>"
