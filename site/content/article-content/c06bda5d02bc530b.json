  "content": "<p>Dave Rupert articulated something in <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/2026/02/computers-were-a-mistake-for-me/\">“Priority of idle hands”</a> that’s been growing in my subconscious for years:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had a small, intrusive realization the other day that computers and the internet are probably bad for me […] This is hard to accept because a lot of my work, hobbies, education, entertainment, news, communities, and curiosities are all on the internet. I love the internet, it’s a big part of who I am today</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hard same. I love computers and the internet. Always have. I feel lucky to have grown up in the late 90’s / early 00’s where I was exposed to the fascination, excitement, and imagination of  PCs, the internet, and then “mobile”. What a time to make websites!</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, I’ve seen how computers and the internet are a two-edged sword for me: I’ve cut out many great opportunities with them, but I’ve also cut myself a lot (and continue to).</p>\n<p>Per Dave’s comments, I have this feeling somewhere inside of me that the internet and computers don’t necessarily align in support my own, personal perspective of what a life well lived is <em>for me</em>. My excitement and draw to them also often leave me with a feeling of “I took that too far.” I still haven’t figured out a completely healthy balance (but I’m also doing ok).</p>\n<p>Dave comes up with a priority of constituencies to deal with his own realization. I like his. Might steal it. But I also think I need to adapt it, make it my own — but I don’t know what that looks like yet.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I don't think I was ready to confront any of this but reading Dave’s blog forced it out of my subconscious and into the open, so now I gotta deal.</p>\n<p>Thanks Dave.</p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/two-edged-sword-of-computers-and-internet/\">Email</a>\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>"
