It is trying as hard as it can to express the totality of visual presentation and layout design and typography and animation and digital interactivity and a few other things in a human-readable text format.  It’s not bloated, it’s fantastically ambitious.  Its reach is greater than most of us can hope to grasp.  Put some <em>respect</em> on its <em>name</em>.</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb/116065151451468199\">Eric Meyer</a></p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/css\">css</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/web-standards\">web-standards</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/eric-meyer\">eric-meyer</a></p>"
