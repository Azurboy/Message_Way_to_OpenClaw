      "content": "<p>The most shameful thing I did in the workplace was lie to a colleague. It was about ten years ago, I was a fresh-faced intern, and in the rush to deliver something I’d skipped the step of testing my work in staging<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup>. It did not work. When deployed to production, it didn’t work there either. No big deal, in general terms: the page we were working on wasn’t yet customer-facing. But my colleague asked me over his desk whether this worked when I’d tested it, and I said something like “it sure did, no idea what happened”.</p>\n<p>I bet he forgot about it immediately. I could have just messed up the testing (for instance, by accidentally running some different code than the code I pushed), or he knew I’d probably lied, and didn’t really care. I haven’t forgotten about it. Even a decade later, I’m still ashamed to write it down.</p>\n<p>Of course I’m not ashamed about the <em>mistake</em>. I was sloppy to not test my work, but I’ve cut corners since then when I felt it was necessary, and I stand by that decision. I’m ashamed about how I handled it. But even that I understand. I was a kid, trying to learn quickly and prove I belonged in tech. The last thing I wanted to do was to dwell on the way I screwed up. If I were in my colleague’s shoes now, I’d have brushed it off too<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup>. How do I try to handle mistakes now?</p>\n<h3>Handling the emotional reaction</h3>\n<p>The most important thing is to <strong>control your emotions</strong>. If you’re anything like me, your strongest emotional reactions at work will be reserved for the times you’ve screwed up. There are usually two countervailing emotions at play here: the desire to defend yourself, find excuses, and minimize the consequences; and the desire to confess your guilt, abase yourself, and beg for forgiveness. Both of these are traps. </p>\n<p>Obviously making excuses for yourself (or flat-out denying the mistake, like I did) is bad. But going in the other direction and publicly beating yourself up about it is <em>just as bad</em>. It’s bad for a few reasons.</p>\n<p>First, you’re effectively asking the people around you to take the time and effort to reassure you, when they should be focused on the problem. Second, you’re taking yourself out of the group of people who are focused on the problem, when often you’re the best situated to figure out what to do: since it’s your mistake, you have the most context. Third, it’s just not professional. </p>\n<p>So what should you do? <strong>For the first little while, <em>do nothing</em>.</strong> Emotional reactions fade over time. Try and just ride out the initial jolt of realizing you screwed up, and the impulse to leap into action to fix it. Most of the worst reactions to screwing up happen in the immediate aftermath, so if you can simply do nothing during that period you’re already off to a good start. For me, this takes about thirty seconds. How much time you’ll need depends on you, but hopefully it’s under ten minutes. More than that and you might need to grit your teeth and work through it.</p>\n<h3>Communicate</h3>\n<p>Once you’re confident you’re under control, the next step is to <strong>tell people what happened</strong>. Typically you want to tell your manager, but depending on the problem it could also be a colleague or someone else. It’s really important here to be matter-of-fact about it, or you risk falling into the “I’m so terrible, please reassure me” trap I discussed above. You often don’t even need to explicitly say “I made a mistake”, if it’s obvious from context. Just say “I deployed a change and it’s broken X feature” (or whatever the problem is).</p>\n<p>You should do this <em>before</em> you’ve come up with a solution. It’s tempting to try to conceal your mistake and just quietly solve it. But for user-facing mistakes, concealment is impossible - somebody will raise a ticket eventually - and if you don’t communicate the issue, you risk someone else discovering it and independently raising it.</p>\n<p>In the worst case, while you’re quietly working on a fix, you’ll discover that somebody else has declared an incident. Of course, you understand the problem perfectly (since you caused it), and you know that it was caused by a bad deploy and is easily fixable. But the other people on the incident call don’t know all that. They’re thinking about the worst-case scenarios, wondering if it’s database or network-related, paging in all kinds of teams, causing all kinds of hassle. All of that could have been avoided if you had reported the issue immediately.</p>\n<p>In my experience, tech company managers will forgive mistakes<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-3\">3</a></sup>, but <strong>they won’t forgive being made to look like a fool</strong>. In particular, they won’t forgive being deprived of critical information. If they’re asked to explain the incident by their boss, and they have to flounder around because they lack the context <em>that you had all along</em>, that may harm your relationship with them for good. On the other hand, if you give them a clear summary of the problem right away, and they’re able to seem like they’re on top of things to their manager, you <em>might</em> even earn credit for the situation (despite having caused it with your initial mistake).</p>\n<h3>Accept that it’s going to hurt</h3>\n<p>However, you probably won’t earn credit. This is where I diverge from the popular software engineering wisdom that incidents are always the fault of systems, never of individuals. Of course incidents are caused by the interactions of complex systems. Everything in the universe is caused by the interactions of complex systems! But one cause in that chain is often <em>somebody screwing up</em><sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-4\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>If you’re a manager of an engineering organization, and you want a project to succeed, you probably have a mental shortlist of the engineers in your org who can reliably lead projects<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-5\">5</a></sup>. If an engineer screws up repeatedly, they’re likely to drop off that list (or at least get an asterisk next to their name).</p>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter if you had a good technical reason to make the mistake, or if it’s excusable. Managers don’t care about that stuff, because they simply don’t have the technical context to know if it’s true or if you’re just trying to talk your way out of it. What managers do have the context to evaluate is <em>results</em>, so that’s what they judge you on. That means some failures are acceptable, so long as you’ve got enough successes to balance them out.</p>\n<p>Being a strong engineer is about finding a balance between <a href=\"/being-right-a-lot\">always being right</a> and <a href=\"/taking-a-position\">taking risks</a>. If you prioritize always being right, you can probably avoid making mistakes, but you won’t be able to lead projects (since that always requires taking risks). Therefore, <strong>the optimal amount of mistakes at work is not zero.</strong> Unless you’re working in a few select industries<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-6\">6</a></sup>, you should <em>expect</em> to make mistakes now and then, otherwise you’re likely working far too slow. </p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>From memory, I think I <em>had</em> tested an earlier version of the code, but then I made some tweaks and skipped the step where I tested that it worked even with those tweaks.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Though I would have made a mental note (and if someone more senior had done this, I would have been a bit less forgiving).</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-2\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>Though they may not forget them. More on that later.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-3\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\n<p>It’s probably not that comforting to replace “you screwed up by being incompetent” with “it’s not your fault, it’s the system’s fault for hiring an engineer as incompetent as you”.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-4\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5\">\n<p>For more on that, see <a href=\"/how-to-ship\"><em>How I ship projects at large tech companies</em></a>.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-5\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-6\">\n<p>The classic examples are pacemakers and the Space Shuttle (should that now be Starship/New Glenn)?</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-6\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

A big part of that is proving to ourselves and to other people that the code we are responsible for behaves as expected.</p>\n<p>This becomes even more important - and challenging - as we embrace coding agents as a core part of our software development process.</p>\n<p>The more code we churn out with agents, the more valuable tools are that reduce the amount of manual QA time we need to spend.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting things about <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/\">the StrongDM software factory model</a> is how they ensure that their software is well tested and delivers value despite their policy that \"code must not be reviewed by humans\". Part of their solution involves expensive swarms of QA agents running through \"scenarios\" to exercise their software. It's fascinating, but I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on QA robots if I can avoid it!</p>\n<p>I need tools that allow agents to clearly demonstrate their work to me, while minimizing the opportunities for them to cheat about what they've done.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"showboat-agents-build-documents-to-demo-their-work\">Showboat: Agents build documents to demo their work</h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat\">Showboat</a></strong> is the tool I built to help agents demonstrate their work to me.</p>\n<p>It's a CLI tool (a Go binary, optionally <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/4/distributing-go-binaries/\">wrapped in Python</a> to make it easier to install) that helps an agent construct a Markdown document demonstrating exactly what their newly developed code can do.</p>\n<p>It's not designed for humans to run, but here's how you would run it anyway:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>showboat init demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>How to use curl and jq<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat note demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Here's how to use curl and jq together.<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\nshowboat <span class=\"pl-c1\">exec</span> demo.md bash <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat note demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat image demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png &amp;&amp; echo curl-logo.png<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Here's what the result looks like if you open it up in VS Code and preview the Markdown:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot showing a Markdown file &quot;demo.md&quot; side-by-side with its rendered preview. The Markdown source (left) shows: &quot;# How to use curl and jq&quot;, italic timestamp &quot;2026-02-10T01:12:30Z&quot;, prose &quot;Here's how to use curl and jq together.&quot;, a bash code block with &quot;curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description&quot;, output block showing '&quot;CLI tool for interacting with the web&quot;', text &quot;And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:&quot;, a bash {image} code block with &quot;curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png &amp;&amp; echo curl-logo.png&quot;, and a Markdown image reference &quot;2056e48f-2026-02-10&quot;. The rendered preview (right) displays the formatted heading, timestamp, prose, styled code blocks, and the curl logo image in dark teal showing &quot;curl://&quot; with circuit-style design elements.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/curl-demo.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Here's that <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/fb0b24696ed8dd91314fe41f4c453563#file-demo-md\">demo.md file in a Gist</a>.</p>\n<p>So a sequence of <code>showboat init</code>, <code>showboat note</code>, <code>showboat exec</code> and <code>showboat image</code> commands constructs a Markdown document one section at a time, with the output of those <code>exec</code> commands automatically added to the document directly following the commands that were run.</p>\n<p>The <code>image</code> command is a little special - it looks for a file path to an image in the output of the command and copies that image to the current folder and references it in the file.</p>\n<p>That's basically the whole thing! There's a <code>pop</code> command to remove the most recently added section if something goes wrong, a <code>verify</code> command to re-run the document and check nothing has changed (I'm not entirely convinced by the design of that one) and a <code>extract</code> command that reverse-engineers the CLI commands that were used to create the document.</p>\n<p>It's pretty simple - just 172 lines of Go.</p>\n<p>I packaged it up with my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/go-to-wheel\">go-to-wheel</a> tool which means you can run it without even installing it first like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx showboat --help</pre></div>\n<p>That <code>--help</code> command is really important: it's designed to provide a coding agent with <em>everything it needs to know</em> in order to use the tool. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/blob/main/help.txt\">that help text in full</a>.</p>\n<p>This means you can pop open Claude Code and tell it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run \"uvx showboat --help\" and then use showboat to create a demo.md document describing the feature you just built</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's it! The <code>--help</code> text acts <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/\">a bit like a Skill</a>. Your agent can read the help text and use every feature of Showboat to create a document that demonstrates whatever it is you need demonstrated.</p>\n<p>Here's a fun trick: if you set Claude off to build a Showboat document you can pop that open in VS Code and watch the preview pane update in real time as the agent runs through the demo. It's a bit like having your coworker talk you through their latest work in a screensharing session.</p>\n<p>And finally, some examples. Here are documents I had Claude create using Showboat to help demonstrate features I was working on in other projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/shot-scraper/README.md\">shot-scraper: A Comprehensive Demo</a> runs through the full suite of features of my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper</a> browser automation tool, mainly to exercise the <code>showboat image</code> command.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/cli.md\">sqlite-history-json CLI demo</a> demonstrates the CLI feature I added to my new <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json\">sqlite-history-json</a> Python library.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/row-state-sql.md\">row-state-sql CLI Demo</a> shows a new <code>row-state-sql</code> command I added to that same project.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/change-grouping.md\">Change grouping with Notes</a> demonstrates another feature where groups of changes within the same transaction can have a note attached to them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/libkrun-go-cli-tool/demo.md\">krunsh: Pipe Shell Commands to an Ephemeral libkrun MicroVM</a> is a particularly convoluted example where I managed to get Claude Code for web to run a libkrun microVM inside a QEMU emulated Linux environment inside the Claude gVisor sandbox.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've now used Showboat often enough that I've convinced myself of its utility.</p>\n<p>(I've also seen agents cheat! Since the demo file is Markdown the agent will sometimes edit that file directly rather than using Showboat, which could result in command outputs that don't reflect what actually happened. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/issues/12\">an issue about that</a>.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"rodney-cli-browser-automation-designed-to-work-with-showboat\">Rodney: CLI browser automation designed to work with Showboat</h4>\n<p>Many of the projects I work on involve web interfaces. Agents often build entirely new pages for these, and I want to see those represented in the demos.</p>\n<p>Showboat's image feature was designed to allow agents to capture screenshots as part of their demos, originally using my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper tool</a> or <a href=\"https://www.playwright.dev\">Playwright</a>.</p>\n<p>The Showboat format benefits from CLI utilities.

It's fantastic - it provides a comprehensive wrapper across basically everything you can do with automated Chrome, all in a self-contained library that compiles to a few MBs.</p>\n<p>All Rod was missing was a CLI.</p>\n<p>I built the first version <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/go-rod-cli/README.md\">as an asynchronous report prototype</a>, which convinced me it was worth spinning out into its own project.</p>\n<p>I called it Rodney as a nod to the Rod library it builds on and a reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Fools_and_Horses\">Only Fools and Horses</a> - and because the package name was available on PyPI.</p>\n<p>You can run Rodney using <code>uvx rodney</code> or install it like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv tool install rodney</pre></div>\n<p>(Or grab a Go binary <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/releases/\">from the releases page</a>.)</p>\n<p>Here's a simple example session:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>rodney start <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> starts Chrome in the background</span>\nrodney open https://datasette.io/\nrodney js <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Array.from(document.links).map(el =&gt; el.href).slice(0, 5)<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nrodney click <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>a[href=\"/for\"]<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nrodney js location.href\nrodney js document.title\nrodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\nrodney stop</pre></div>\n<p>Here's what that looks like in the terminal:</p>\n<p><img alt=\";~ % rodney start\nChrome started (PID 91462)\nDebug URL: ws://127.0.0.1:64623/devtools/browser/cac6988e-8153-483b-80b9-1b75c611868d\n~ % rodney open https://datasette.io/\nDatasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data\n~ % rodney js 'Array.from(document.links).map(el =&gt; el.href).slice(0, 5)'\n[\n&quot;https://datasette.io/for&quot;,\n&quot;https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/tutorials&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/examples&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/plugins&quot;\n]\n~ % rodney click 'a[href=&quot;/for&quot;]'\nClicked\n~ % rodney js location.href\nhttps://datasette.io/for\n~ % rodney js document.title\nUse cases for Datasette\n~ % rodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\ndatasette-for-page.png\n~ % rodney stop\nChrome stopped\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/rodney-demo.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>As with Showboat, this tool is not designed to be used by humans! The goal is for coding agents to be able to run <code>rodney --help</code> and see everything they need to know to start using the tool. You can see <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/help.txt\">that help output</a> in the GitHub repo.</p>\n<p>Here are three demonstrations of Rodney that I created using Showboat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/rodney/README.md\">Rodney's original feature set</a>, including screenshots of pages and executing JavaScript.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/notes/accessibility-features/README.md\">Rodney's new accessibility testing features</a>, built during development of those features to show what they could do.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/datasette-database-page-accessibility-audit/README.md\">Using those features to run a basic accessibility audit of a page</a>. I was impressed at how well Claude Opus 4.6 responded to the prompt \"Use showboat and rodney to perform an accessibility audit of <a href=\"https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures\">https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures</a>\" - <a href=\"https://gisthost.github.io/?dce6b2680db4b05c04469ed8f251eb34/index.html\">transcript here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"test-driven-development-helps-but-we-still-need-manual-testing\">Test-driven development helps, but we still need manual testing</h4>\n<p>After being a career-long skeptic of the test-first, maximum test coverage school of software development (I like <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/#tests\">tests included</a> development instead) I've recently come around to test-first processes as a way to force agents to write only the code that's necessary to solve the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>Many of my Python coding agent sessions start the same way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run the existing tests with \"uv run pytest\". Build using red/green TDD.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Telling the agents how to run the tests doubles as an indicator that tests on this project exist and matter. Agents will read existing tests before writing their own so having a clean test suite with good patterns makes it more likely they'll write good tests of their own.</p>\n<p>The frontier models all understand that \"red/green TDD\" means they should write the test first, run it and watch it fail and then write the code to make it pass - it's a convenient shortcut.</p>\n<p>I find this greatly increases the quality of the code and the likelihood that the agent will produce the right thing with the smallest amount of prompts to guide it.</p>\n<p>But anyone who's worked with tests will know that just because the automated tests pass doesn't mean the software actually works! That’s the motivation behind Showboat and Rodney - I never trust any feature until I’ve seen it running with my own eye.</p>\n<p>Before building Showboat I'd often add a “manual” testing step to my agent sessions, something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Once the tests pass, start a development server and exercise the new feature using curl</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"i-built-both-of-these-tools-on-my-phone\">I built both of these tools on my phone</h4>\n<p>Both Showboat and Rodney started life as Claude Code for web projects created via the Claude iPhone app. Most of the ongoing feature work for them happened in the same way.</p>\n<p>I'm still a little startled at how much of my coding work I get done on my phone now, but I'd estimate that the majority of code I ship to GitHub these days was written for me by coding agents driven via that iPhone app.</p>\n<p>I initially designed these two tools for use in asynchronous coding agent environments like Claude Code for the web. So far that's working out really well.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/go\">go</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/testing\">testing</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/markdown\">markdown</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/async-coding-agents\">async-coding-agents</a></p>",

A fellow commissioner and I decided to take a long lunchtime walk along the coast. As we chatted, we realized we had both worked on several of the same very classified programs. His involvement was in acquisition and finance, while mine was more deeply connected to the engineering development of the project and hands-on with the operators on site.</span></p>\n<p><b>We Got Our Advanced Technology From Aliens<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we both were discreet about not talking about specifics, we recognized the projects we had worked on. So you can imagine my surprise when he turned to me and casually said, &#8220;You know this technology came from aliens.&#8221; I laughed, thinking that obviously he must be joking. But as we continued walking he continued on, claiming, “You know the equipment you worked on and stuff that followed came from our secret alien investigation site at <a href=\"https://www.military.com/off-duty/2020/12/18/6-urban-legends-about-wright-patterson-air-force-base.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wright Patterson Air Force Base</a>. All we did was reverse engineer Alien technology.” This time I stopped in my tracks and looked at him to see if he was smiling. I was puzzled as he looked dead serious. He explained that there was no possible way we could be doing what we were doing using existing technology. Before I changed the subject I asked him how he knew this, he replied with absolute sincerity, “I was head of acquisition on the program. I was briefed on the project. That&#8217;s what they told us and they swore us to secrecy.“<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33503\" height=\"143\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?resize=300%2C143&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"300\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really didn&#8217;t know how to process this. He was really a smart and level-headed guy. In fact he was the mayor at the time of Rancho Palos Verde. It took me a mile or two into our walk to rethink everything I knew about the project (even then it had been in decades past), including having sat with a few of the engineers (some strange, but not aliens) as they were designing the system (with me trying to keep up with the revised blueprints in document control), and then watching the system being built and assembled. While it had required incredibly creative engineering, and applying technology on a scale so massive no commercial company could afford it, this system was built by smart people with no aliens involved. But he was equally convinced they were. Over our time together on the commission we took more walks, had lots more to talk about, but we never broached the subject again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every once in a while, for the next few years, I puzzled on how he could have been so sure of something that I was sure was completely wrong.</span></p>\n<p><b>We Did Tell Them It Was Aliens<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward 15 years, and my world view of that conversation was upended when I read in the </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wall Street Journal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Department of Defense had been running a disinformation campaign, briefing finance and acquisition people that the technology for these classified programs </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> coming from aliens. (Take a minute and </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">read the article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of a sudden our coast-side conversation from a decade and a half ago made sense to me. Most of our most compartmentalized programs have different levels of what was called &#8220;</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need to know</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&#8221; I never paid much attention as I was </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_access_program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">read all the way into</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the technical and operational details of these programs. I vaguely knew that others got fewer details, but as I was just discovering, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">others had received active disinformation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In a few cases, security officers were even using fake photos and documents to create the Alien cover-story for secret-weapons programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It turns out my fellow commissioner had been briefed by the U.S. government that it was Aliens, and he went to his grave believing it so. </span></p>\n<p><b>Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s interesting is what happened after the news came out that the Alien story was government disinformation. A large percentage of people who were briefed, now &#8220;doubled down&#8221; and believed “we got the technology from Aliens” even more strongly &#8211; believing the new information itself was a coverup. Many dismissed the facts by prioritizing how they felt over reality, something we often see in political or religious contexts.

These top secret projects gave rise to decades of UFO sightings. Instead of acknowledging these sightings were from classified military projects the Department of Defense issued cover stories (&#8220;you saw weather balloons&#8221;) that weren&#8217;t believable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Governments and companies have always kept secrets and used misinformation and manipulation. However, things stay secret way too long &#8211; for many reasons &#8211; some reasonable (we’re still using the same methods &#8211; reconnaissance technology, tradecraft, or, it would harm people still alive &#8211; retired spies, etc) or not so reasonable (we broke U.S. or international laws &#8211; </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COINTELPRO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or it would embarrass us or our allies &#8211; Kennedy assassination, or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_files\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Epstein files</a>).  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secrecy increases the odds of conspiracy beliefs. Because evidence can’t be checked, contradictions can’t be audited, a government “cover-up” becomes a plausible explanation. People don’t tolerate “I don’t know” for long when stakes are high (stolen elections, identity, national crises, the meaning of life, or what happens when we die). That vacuum gets filled by the most emotionally satisfying model: a hidden “higher power” concealing information and controlling events.</span></p>\n<p><b>Summary<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as social media replaced traditional news sources, AI-driven summaries of current events are likely to replace our understanding of the world around us. What happens to trust when AI manipulates human&#8217;s tendency to embrace conspiracy theories? Who will define the truth in the brave new world?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And by the way, I’m still pretty sure we didn&#8217;t get it from Aliens.</span></p>",

This is a wryly funny and cosily charming book about council funerals.</p>\n\n<p>Evie King conducts Section 46 funerals under the Public Health Act. If you die and there's no one else around who is able to arrange your funeral, the local council steps in. This could be a coldly bureaucratic process with no wiggle room for anything other than perfunctory sympathy. But humans are going to human. Why <em>wouldn't</em> you put some effort in to making people feel cherished in death?</p>\n\n<p>In many ways, this is what Cameron's \"Big Society\" should have been about. Giving empathetic and passionate people a chance to serve their community and enrich all our lives. And, I guess, deaths. But austerity makes it hard to stay motivated when you're doing multiple people's jobs for a fraction of the pay.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't to say King is a whinger - quite the opposite - but she is clearly frustrated that she cannot do more. People who interact with the state are rarely in a good emotional or financial place. Those interacting with Section 46 deserve more support than is available to them. What King does is marvellous - but necessarily limited. In effect, it is a series of short stories each taking a look at a different death and how she tried as hard as possible to make the funeral process as painless and uplifting as it can be.</p>\n\n<p>The book is, naturally, a little upsetting in places. It isn't so much that people die; it is how society reacts which causes such emotional turmoil. Why are people sometimes abandoned? Why do reconciliations never happen until it is too late? How do we deal with trauma?</p>\n\n<p>It is an excellent book but it is rather annoying that the publisher, <a href=\"https://www.mirrorbooks.co.uk/\">Mirror Books</a> only makes the eBook available via Amazon. There's no other way to read it - not even via a library! I resorted to borrowing the audiobook. This was the first audiobook I've ever listened to - and it was a rather curious experience. The author's voice was slightly hesitant at first, but gradually became more passionate and evocative. It was wonderful to hear her tell her story directly.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Whilst I was implementing a <a href=\"https://github.com/git-pkgs/git-pkgs/pull/98\">vendor command in git-pkgs</a>, I noticed that not many package manager clients have native vendoring commands. Go has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">go mod vendor</code>, Cargo has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cargo vendor</code>, and Bundler has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bundle cache</code>. That’s most of the first-class support I could find, which surprised me for something that used to be the dominant way to manage dependencies. So I went looking for what happened.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vendoring-under-svn\">Vendoring under SVN</h3>\n\n<p>Before lockfiles and registries, if you wanted reproducible builds you checked your dependencies into source control. The alternative was hoping the internet served you the same bytes tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Under Subversion this worked fine. SVN checkouts only pull the current revision of the directories you ask for, leaving everything else on the server. You never download previous versions of vendored files, so a dependency updated twenty times costs you the same as one updated once. A 200MB vendor directory doesn’t slow you down if you never check it out, and CI can do the same. Most developers on a project never touched <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> directly, and the cost of carrying all that third-party code was invisible to everyone who wasn’t actively updating it.</p>\n\n<p>Rails formalized the convention with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> for third-party code and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lib/</code> for your own. You could even freeze the Rails framework itself into your vendor directory with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rake rails:freeze:gems</code>. Chris Wanstrath’s “Vendor Everything” post on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/2007/http://errtheblog.com/posts/50-vendor-everything\">err the blog</a> in 2007 named the philosophy, though the practice traces back to 2006. Ryan McGeary updated it for the Bundler era in 2011 with <a href=\"http://ryan.mcgeary.org/2011/02/09/vendor-everything-still-applies/\">“Vendor Everything Still Applies”</a>: “Storage is cheap. You’ll thank me later when your deployments run smoothly.” Bundler’s arrival was effectively Rails admitting that physical vendoring was a dead end: pin versions in a lockfile instead. Composer made <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> its default install target. The name stuck because it was already familiar.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"git-clone\">git clone</h3>\n\n<p>Git clones the entire repository history by default. Every developer, every CI run, gets everything. A vendored dependency updated twenty times means twenty snapshots of its source tree in your .git directory, forever. Shallow clones and partial clones help, but as I wrote in <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/24/package-managers-keep-using-git-as-a-database/\">package managers keep using git as a database</a>, they’re workarounds for a problem SVN never had.</p>\n\n<p>The weight became visible in ways it hadn’t been before: code search indexed everything in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code>. GitHub’s language statistics counted vendored code unless you added <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">linguist-vendored</code> to .gitattributes. Pull requests touching <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> generated walls of diff noise. The developer experience of working with a vendored codebase went from tolerable to actively painful.</p>\n\n<p>Security tooling piled on: GitHub’s dependency graph, Dependabot, and similar tools parse lockfiles and manifests to find vulnerable dependencies. Vendored code is invisible to them unless you go out of your way to make it discoverable. The entire vulnerability scanning ecosystem assumed lockfiles won and built around that assumption, which created a feedback loop: the more teams relied on automated scanning, the more vendoring looked like a liability rather than a safety net.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lockfiles-and-registries\">Lockfiles and registries</h3>\n\n<p>Bundler shipped Gemfile.lock in 2010, one of the first lockfiles to pin exact dependency versions with enough information to reproduce an install. But the ecosystem where vendoring arguments ran hottest didn’t have one for years. npm launched in 2010 too, and you’d specify <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">^1.2.0</code> in package.json and get whatever the registry served that day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2016/10/11/web/yarn-a-new-package-manager-for-javascript/\">Yarn launched</a> in October 2016 with yarn.lock and content hashes from day one. npm followed with <a href=\"https://blog.npmjs.org/post/161081169345/v500\">package-lock.json in npm 5.0</a> in May 2017. Once lockfiles recorded exact versions and integrity hashes (I covered the design choices in <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/17/lockfile-format-design-and-tradeoffs/\">lockfile format design and tradeoffs</a>), you got reproducible builds without storing the code. The lockfile records what to fetch, the registry serves it, and the hash proves nothing changed in transit.</p>\n\n<p>Lockfiles spread to every major ecosystem. The <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/11/15/package-manager-timeline\">package manager timeline</a> shows them arriving in waves: Bundler in 2010, Cargo.lock with Rust in 2015, Yarn and npm in 2016-2017, Poetry and uv bringing proper lockfiles to Python. Each one made vendoring less necessary for that community.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"left-pad\">left-pad</h3>\n\n<p>In March 2016, a developer <a href=\"https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm\">unpublished the 11-line left-pad package</a> from npm and broke builds across the ecosystem, including React and Babel. The immediate reaction was a rush back toward vendoring. If the registry can just delete packages, how can you trust it?</p>\n\n<p>The long-term response went the other way: npm <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish\">tightened its unpublish policy</a>. Lockfiles with content hashes meant even a re-uploaded package with different code would be caught. And enterprise proxy caches like <a href=\"https://jfrog.com/artifactory/\">Artifactory</a> filled the remaining availability gap: a local mirror that your builds pull from, still serving packages even when the upstream registry goes down or a maintainer rage-quits. The availability guarantee of vendoring, without anything in your git history.</p>\n\n<p>left-pad is sometimes framed as vindication for vendoring. I think it was the moment the industry decided to <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/22/package-registries-are-governance-as-a-service/\">fix registry governance</a> rather than abandon registries altogether.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-c-shaped-hole\">The C-shaped hole</h3>\n\n<p>C never went through this transition because it never had the prerequisites: no dominant language package manager, no central registry that everyone publishes to, and no lockfile format. A lockfile is just a pointer to something in a registry, and if there’s no reliable registry to point to, you have to bring the code with you.</p>\n\n<p>As I wrote in <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/27/the-c-shaped-hole-in-package-management/\">The C-Shaped Hole in Package Management</a>, developers are still dropping .c and .h files into source trees the way they have since the 1970s. Libraries like SQLite and stb are distributed as single files specifically to make this easy. Conan and vcpkg exist now, but neither has the cultural ubiquity that would make vendoring unnecessary. Without a registry everyone agrees on, vendoring in C remains the path of least resistance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"go-and-the-google-problem\">Go and the Google problem</h3>\n\n<p>Go was one of the last major languages to move past vendoring, and the reason traces straight back to Google. Go was designed at Google, by Google engineers, for Google’s development workflow. Google runs a monorepo and prizes hermetic builds: every build must be fully reproducible from what’s in the repository, with zero outside dependencies. Vendoring is how you get hermeticity, so all third-party code lives in the repository alongside first-party code, maintained by dedicated teams and managed by advanced tooling.</p>\n\n<p>So Go shipped without a real package manager. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">go get</code> fetched the latest commit from a repository with no versions, no lockfiles, and no registry. Russ Cox later acknowledged this in his <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/vgo\">Go += Package Versioning</a> series: “It was clear in the very first discussions of goinstall [in 2010] that we needed to do something about versioning. Unfortunately, it was not clear… exactly what to do.” They didn’t experience the pain internally because Google’s monorepo doesn’t need versions, since everything builds at head.</p>\n\n<p>The community filled the gap with godep, glide, and dep, and all of them used a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> directory. <a href=\"https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25719-go15vendor.md\">Go 1.5 formalized vendoring support</a> in 2015, blessing what everyone was already doing. For five years, vendoring was the official answer.</p>\n\n<p>Go modules arrived in Go 1.11 in 2018 with go.mod and go.sum. But the piece that actually replaced vendoring came later: the module proxy at proxy.golang.org and the checksum database at sum.golang.org. Russ Cox argued in <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/vgo-module\">Defining Go Modules</a> that the proxy made vendor directories “almost entirely redundant.” The proxy caches modules indefinitely and the sum database verifies integrity, so together they provide monorepo-level guarantees to people who don’t have a monorepo: if the source disappears, the proxy still has it; if the code changes, the checksum catches it.</p>\n\n<p>As of this writing, Kubernetes still vendors its dependencies, a large project with the discipline to keep vendored code current, the same discipline Google has in its monorepo. Most teams don’t have that discipline, and for them, vendored dependencies go stale quietly until someone discovers a CVE six versions behind.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"nix-and-guix\">Nix and Guix</h3>\n\n<p>Nix and Guix take the idea in a different direction. They do something that looks a lot like vendoring but with different mechanics, and they go further than anyone else ever did. Nix doesn’t just vendor your libraries but the entire build closure: the library, the compiler that built it, the linker, the kernel headers. Every input gets copied into a content-addressed store, pinned by hash. A Nix <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">flake.lock</code> file pins exact input revisions and gets committed to the repository, while <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nix build</code> fetches everything into <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/nix/store</code> where it lives alongside every other version of every other package, isolated and immutable.</p>\n\n<p>It’s hermeticity without the monorepo. You get offline builds, exact reproducibility, and a verifiable record of what went into your project. But the code lives in the Nix store rather than your repository, so you don’t pay the git history cost that made traditional vendoring painful. The tradeoff is complexity: you need to buy into Nix’s model of the world, and the learning curve is steep.</p>\n\n<p>If the vendoring instinct was always about control (knowing exactly what code you’re running, not depending on a registry being up and honest), then Nix is where that instinct ended up for the people who took it the most seriously.</p>",

What can the opposition party do without majorities in either house? Well, they could start by refusing to continue to fund ICE, a masked thug snatch/murder squad that roams our streets, killing with impunity:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273\">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273</a></p>\n<p>That's table stakes. What would a <em>real</em> political response to fascism look like? Again, it wouldn't stop with banning masks for ICE goons, or even requiring them to wear QR codes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345\">https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345</a></p>\n<p>Though it should be noted that ICE hates this idea, and that ICE agents wear masks because they fear consequences for their sadistic criminality:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/0LNh8\">https://archive.is/0LNh8</a></p>\n<p>This despite the fact that the (criminally culpable) Vice President has assured them that they have absolute impunity, no matter who they kill:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis\">https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis</a></p>\n<p>The fact that ICE agents worry about consequences despite Vance's assurances suggests ways that Dems could \"meet the moment.\"</p>\n<p>I think Dems should start a Nuremberg Caucus, named for the Nazi war-crimes trials that followed from the defeat of German fascists and the death of their leader:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials</a></p>\n<p>What would this caucus do? Well, it could have a public website where it assembled and organized the evidence for the trials that the Democrats could promise to bring after the Trump regime falls. Each fresh outrage, each statement, each video-clip &#8211; whether of Trump officials or of his shock-troops &#8211; could be neatly slotted in, given an exhibit number, and annotated with the criminal and civil violations captured in the evidence.</p>\n<p>The caucus could publish dates these trials will be held on &#8211; following from Jan 20, 2029 &#8211; and even which courtrooms each official, high and low, will be tried in. These dates could be changed as new crimes emerge, making sure the most egregious offenses are always at the top of the agenda. Each trial would have a witness list.</p>\n<p>The Nuremberg Caucus could vow to repurpose ICE's $75b budget to pursue Trump's crimes, from corruption to civil rights violations to labor violations to environmental violations. It could announce its intent to fully fund the FTC and DoJ Antitrust Division to undertake scrutiny of all mergers approved under Trump, and put corporations on notice that they should expect lengthy, probing inquiries into any mergers they undertake between now and the fall of Trumpism. Who knows, perhaps some shareholders will demand that management hold off on mergers in anticipation of this lookback scrutiny, and if not, perhaps they will sue executives after the FTC and DoJ go to work.</p>\n<p>While they're at it, the Nuremberg Caucus could publish a plan to hire thousands of <em>IRS</em> agents (paid for by taxing billionaires and zeroing out ICE's budget) who will focus exclusively on the ultra-wealthy and especially any supernormal wealth gains coinciding with the second Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>Money talks. ICE agents are signing up with the promise of $50k hiring bonuses and $60k in student debt cancellation. That's peanuts. The Nuremberg Caucus could announce a Crimestoppers-style program with $1m bounties for any ICE officer who a) is themselves innocent of any human rights violations, and; b) provides evidence leading to the conviction of another ICE officer for committing human rights violations. That would certainly improve morale for (some) ICE officers.</p>\n<p>Critics of this plan will say that this will force Trump officials to try to steal the next election in order to avoid consequences for their actions. This is certainly true: confidence in a \"peaceful transfer of power\" is the bedrock of any kind of fair election.</p>\n<p>But this bunch have already <em>repeatedly</em> signaled that they intend to steal the midterms and the next general election:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html\">https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html</a></p>\n<p>ICE agents are straight up telling people that ICE is on the streets to arrest people in Democratic-leaning states (\"The more people that you lose in Minnesota, you then lose a voting right to stay blue\"):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/\">https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/</a></p>\n<p>The only path to fair elections &#8211; and saving America &#8211; lies through mobilizing and energizing hundreds of millions of Americans. They are ready. They are <em>begging</em> for leadership. They want an electoral <em>choice</em>, something better than a return to the pre-Trump status quo. If you want giant crowds at every polling place, rising up against ICE and DHS voter-suppression, then you have to promise people that their vote will <em>mean</em> something.</p>\n<p>Dems have to pick a side. That means being against anyone who is for fascism &#8211; including other Dems. The Nuremberg Caucus should denounce the disgusting child abuse perpetrated by the Trump regime:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children\">https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children</a></p>\n<p>But they should also denounce Democrats who vote to fund that abuse:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html\">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html</a></p>\n<p>The people of Minneapolis (and elsewhere) have repeatedly proven that we outnumber fascists by a huge margin.

They were woven into the core of Blade Runner's society with a temporal Sword of Damocles hung over their head: four years of life, not a day more. This made replicants desperate to cling to life; they'd kill for the chance of an hour more. This is why the job of the Blade Runner was so deadly.</p>\n        <p>Metanarratively, the replicants weren't the problem. The problem was the people that made them. The people that gave them the ability to think. The ability to feel. The ability to understand and emphathize. The problem was the people that gave them the ability to enjoy life and then hit them with a temporal Sword of Damocles overhead because those replicants were fundamentally disposable.</p>\n        <p>In Blade Runner, the true horror was not the technology. The technology worked fine. The horror was the deployment and the societal implications around making people disposable. I wonder what underclass of people like that exists today.</p>\n        <div class=\"flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1\"><div class=\"h-16 not-prose\"><img alt=\"Numa is neutral\" class=\"h-16 w-16 rounded-xs\" src=\"https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/neutral\" /></div><div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\"><span class=\"font-semibold text-sm block mb-1\"><a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa\">Numa</a></span><span class=\"mx-auto\"></span><div class=\"text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2\"><p>This is why science fiction is inseparable from social commentary, all the\n        best art does this.

With these new flows, the cost to integrate any two systems is approaching zero; the most expensive thing is time. People don't read documentation anymore, that's a job for their AI agents. Mental labour is shifting from flesh and blood to HBM and coil whine. The thing doing the &quot;actual work&quot; is its own kind of replicant and as long as the results &quot;work&quot;, many humans don't even review the output before shipping it.</p>\n        <p>Looking at this, I think I see where a future could end up. Along this line, I've started to think about how programming is going to change and what humanity's &quot;last programming language&quot; could look like. I don't think we'll stop making new ones (nerds are compulsive language designers), but I think that in the fallout of AI tools being so widespread the <em>shape</em> of what &quot;a program&quot; is might be changing drastically out from under us while we argue about tabs, spaces, and database frameworks.</p>\n        <p>Let's consider a future where markdown files are the new executables. For the sake of argument, let's call this result Markdownlang.</p>\n        <h2>Markdownlang</h2>\n        <p>Markdownlang is an AI-native programming environment built with structured outputs and Markdown. Every markdownlang program is an AI agent with its own agentic loop generating output or calling tools to end up with structured output following a per-program schema.</p>\n        <p>Instead of using a parser, lexer, or traditional programming runtime, markdownlang programs are executed by large language models running an agentic inference loop with structured JSON and a templated prompt as an input and then emitting structured JSON as a response.</p>\n        <p>Markdownlang programs can import other markdownlang programs as dependencies. In that case they will just show up as other tools like any other. If you need to interact with existing systems or programs, you are expected to expose those tools via <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro\">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> servers. MCP tools get added to the runtime the same way any other tools would. Those MCP tools are how you do web searches, make GitHub issues, or update tickets in Linear.</p>\n        <h3>Why?</h3>\n        <p>Before you ask why, lemme cover the state of the art with the AI ecosystem for discrete workflows like the kind markdownlang enables: it's a complete fucking nightmare. Every week we get new agent frameworks, DSLs, paridigms, or CLI tools that only work with one provider for no reason. In a desperate attempt to appear relevant, everything has massive complexity creep requiring you(r AI agent) to write miles of YAML, struggle through brittle orchestration, and makes debugging a nightmare.</p>\n        <p>The hype says that this mess will replace programmers, but speaking as someone who uses these tools professionally in an effort to figure out if there really is something there to them, I'm not really sure it will. Even accounting for multiple generational improvements.</p>\n        <h3>The core of markdownlang</h3>\n        <p>With this in mind, let's take a look at what markdownlang brings to the table.</p>\n        <p>The most important concept with markdownlang is that your documentation and your code are the same thing. One of the biggest standing problems with documentation is that the best way to make any bit of it out of date is to write it down in any capacity. Testing documentation becomes onerous because over time humans gain enough finesse to not require it anymore. One of the biggest advantages of AI models for this usecase is that they legitimately cannot remember things between tasks, so your documentation being bad means the program won't execute consistently.</p>\n        <p>Other than that, everything is just a composable agent. Agents become tools that can be used by other agents, and strictly typed schemata holds the entire façade together. No magic required.</p>\n        <p>Oh, also the markdownlang runtime has an embedded python interpreter using WebAssembly and WASI. The runtime does not have access to any local filesystem folders. It is purely there because language models have been trained to shell out to Python to do calculations (I'm assuming someone was inspired by <a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/strawberry\">my satirical post where I fixed the &quot;strawberry&quot; problem with AI models</a>).</p>\n        <h2>Fizzbuzz</h2>\n        <p>Here's what Fizzbuzz looks like in markdownlang:</p>\n        <pre

abstraction</h2>\n        <p>Yeah, I realize that a lot of this is high-brow shitposting, but really the best way to think about something like markdownlang is that it's a new layer of abstraction. In something like markdownlang the real abstraction you deal with is the specifications that you throw around in Jira/Linear instead of dealing with the low level machine pedantry that is endemic to programming in today's Internet.</p>\n        <p>Imagine how much more you could get done if you could just ask the computer to do it. This is the end of syntax issues, of semicolon fights, of memorizing APIs, of compiler errors because some joker used sed to replace semicolons with greek question marks. Everything becomes strictly typed data that acts as the guardrails between snippets of truly high level language.</p>\n        <p>Like, looking at the entire langle mangle programming space from that angle, the user experience at play here is that kind of science fiction magic you see in Star Trek. You just ask the computer to adjust the Norokov phase variance of the phasers to a triaxilating frequency and it figures out what you mean and does it. This is the kind of magic that Apple said they'd do with AI in their big keynote <a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/\">right before they squandered that holy grail</a>.</p>\n        <p>Even then, this is still just programming. Schemata are your new types, imports are your new dependencies, composition is your new architecture, debugging is still debugging, and the massive MCP ecosystem becomes an integration boon instead of a burden.</p>\n        <p>Markdownlang is just a tool. Large language models can (and let's face it: will) make mistakes. Schemata can't express absolutely everything. Someone needs to write these agents and even if something like this becomes so widespread, I'm pretty sure that programmers are still safe in terms of their jobs.</p>\n        <p>If only because in order for us to truly be replaced, the people that hire us have to know what they want at a high enough level of detail in order to specify it such that markdownlang can make it possible. I'd be willing to argue that when we get hired as programmers, we get hired to have that level of deep clear thinking to be able to come up with the kinds of requirements to get to the core business goal regardless of the tools we use to get it done.</p>\n        <p>It's not <em>that</em> deep.</p>\n        <h2>Future ideas</h2>\n        <p>From here something like this has many obvious and immediate usecases. It's quite literally a universal lingua franca for integrating any square peg into any other round hole. The big directions I could go from here include:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>Some kind of web platform for authoring and deploying markdownlang programs (likely with some level of MCP exposure so that you can tell your Claude Code to make an agent do something every hour or so and have it just Do The Right Thing™️ spawning something in the background).</li>\n        <li>It would be really funny to make a <code>markdownlang compile</code> command that just translates the markdownlang program to Go, Python, or JavaScript; complete with the MCP imports as direct function calls.</li>\n        <li>I'd love to make some kind of visual flow editor in that web platform, maybe there's some kind of product potential here. It would be really funny to attribute markdownlang to Techaro's AGI lab (Lygma).</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>But really, I think working on markdownlang (I do have a fully working version of it, I'm not releasing it yet) has made me understand a lot more of the nuance that I feel with AI tools. That melodrama of Blade Runner has been giving me pause when I look at what I have just created and making me understand the true horror of why I find AI tooling so cool and disturbing at the same time.</p>\n        <p>The problem is not the technology. The real horror reveals itself when you consider how technology is deployed and the societal implications around what could happen when a tool like markdownlang makes programmers like me societally disposable. When &quot;good enough&quot; becomes the ceiling instead of the floor, we're going to lose something we can't easily get back.</p>\n        <p>The real horror for me is knowing that this kind of tool is not only possible to build with things off the shelf, but knowing that I did build it by having a small swarm of Claudes Code go off and build it while I did raiding in Final Fantasy 14. I haven't looked at basically any of the code (intentionally, it's part of The Bit™️), and it just works well enough that I didn't feel the need to dig into it in much detail. It's as if programmers now have our own Sword of Damocles over our heads because management can point at the tool and say &quot;behave more like this or we'll replace you&quot;.</p>\n        <p>This is the level of nuance I feel about this technology that can't fit into a single tweet. I love this idea of programming as description, but I hate how something like this will be treated by the market should it be widely released.</p>\n        <div class=\"flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1\"><div class=\"h-16 not-prose\"><img alt=\"Cadey is coffee\" class=\"h-16 w-16 rounded-xs\" src=\"https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee\" /></div><div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\"><span class=\"font-semibold text-sm block mb-1\"><a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey\">Cadey</a></span><span class=\"mx-auto\"></span><div class=\"text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2\"><p>For those of you entrenched in The Deep Lore™️, this post was authored in the\n        voice of <a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters/#numa\">Numa</a>.</p></div></div></div>",

      "content": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05447\">Structured Context Engineering for File-Native Agentic Systems</a></strong></p>\nNew paper by Damon McMillan exploring challenging LLM context tasks involving large SQL schemas (up to 10,000 tables) across different models and file formats:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using SQL generation as a proxy for programmatic agent operations, we present a systematic study of context engineering for structured data, comprising 9,649 experiments across 11 models, 4 formats (YAML, Markdown, JSON, Token-Oriented Object Notation [TOON]), and schemas ranging from 10 to 10,000 tables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the biggest impact was the models themselves - with frontier models (Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro) beating the leading open source models (DeepSeek V3.2, Kimi K2, Llama 4).</p>\n<p>Those frontier models benefited from filesystem based context retrieval, but the open source models had much less convincing results with those, which reinforces my feeling that the filesystem coding agent loops aren't handled as well by open weight models just yet. The <a href=\"https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard/terminal-bench/2.0\">Terminal Bench 2.0</a> leaderboard is still dominated by Anthropic, OpenAI and Gemini.</p>\n<p>The \"grep tax\" result against <a href=\"https://github.com/toon-format/toon\">TOON</a> was an interesting detail. TOON is meant to represent structured data in as few tokens as possible, but it turns out the model's unfamiliarity with that format led to them spending significantly more tokens over multiple iterations trying to figure it out:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of a figure from a research paper. Introductory text reads: &quot;As schema size increased, TOON showed dramatically increased token consumption for Claude models despite being ~25% smaller in file size. Scale experiments used Claude models only.&quot; Below is &quot;Figure 7: The 'Grep Tax' - TOON Token Overhead at Scale&quot;, a bar chart with a logarithmic y-axis labeled &quot;Tokens&quot; comparing YAML (teal) and TOON (purple) at two schema sizes: S5 (500 tables) and S9 (10,000 tables). At S5, TOON is +138% more tokens than YAML (~1,100 vs ~450). At S9, TOON is +740% more tokens (~50,000 vs ~7,000). Below the chart, explanatory text reads: &quot;The 'grep tax' emerged as schema size scaled. At S5 (500 tables), TOON consumed 138% more tokens than YAML; at S9 (10,000 tables), this grew to 740%. Root cause: models lacked familiarity with TOON's syntax and could not construct effective refinement patterns.&quot;\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/grep-tax.jpg\" />\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2020150077637997013\">@omarsar0</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-engineering\">prompt-engineering</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/paper-review\">paper-review</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/context-engineering\">context-engineering</a></p>",

They did this, in part, because they felt they had a “partner” that could help them move through their workload.</p>\n<p>While this sense of having a “partner” enabled a feeling of momentum, the reality was a continual switching of attention, frequent checking of AI outputs, and a growing number of open tasks. This created cognitive load and a sense of always juggling, even as the work felt productive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm frequently finding myself with work on two or three projects running parallel. I can get <em>so much done</em>, but after just an hour or two my mental energy for the day feels almost entirely depleted.</p>\n<p>I've had conversations with people recently who are losing sleep because they're finding building yet another feature with \"just one more prompt\" irresistible.</p>\n<p>The HBR piece calls for organizations to build an \"AI practice\" that structures how AI is used to help avoid burnout and counter effects that \"make it harder for organizations to distinguish genuine productivity gains from unsustainable intensity\".</p>\n<p>I think we've just disrupted decades of existing intuition about sustainable working practices.

      "content": "<p>If you call a wait function like <code>Wait­For­Single­Object</code> and receive the code <code>WAIT_ABANDONED</code>, what does it mean and what should you do?</p>\n<p>The documentation says that <code>WAIT_ABANDONED</code> means that you successfully claimed a mutex, but the thread that previously owned the mutex failed to release the mutex before it exited. This could be an oversight because the code encountered a code path that forgot to release the mutex. Or it could be because the thread crashed before it could release the mutex.</p>\n<p>The documentation also suggests that &#8220;If the mutex was protecting persistent state information, you should check it for consistency.&#8221; This is to handle the second case: The thread crashes before it can release the mutex. If the purpose of the mutex was to prevent other threads from accessing the data while it is in an inconsistent state, then the fact that the thread crashed while holding the mutex means that the data might still be in that inconsistent state.</p>\n<p>Now, maybe you have no way to check whether the data is in an inconsistent state or have no way to repair it if such an inconsistent state is discovered. (Most people don&#8217;t bother to design their data structures with rollback or transactions, because the point of the mutex was to avoid having to write that fancy code in the first place!) In that case, you really have only two choices.</p>\n<p>One option is to just cover your ears and pretend you didn&#8217;t hear anything. Just continue operating normally and hope that any latent corruption is not going to cause major problems.</p>\n<p>Another option is to give up and abandon the operation. However, if that&#8217;s your choice, you have to give up properly.</p>\n<p>The abandoned state is not sticky; is reported only to the <i>first</i> person to wait for the mutex after it was abandoned. Subsequent waits succeed normally. Therefore, if you decide, &#8220;Oh it&#8217;s corrupted, I&#8217;m not touching it,&#8221; and release the mutex and walk away, then the next person to wait for the mutex will receive a normal successful wait, and they will dive in, unaware that the data structures are corrupted!</p>\n<p>One solution is to add a flag inside your data that says &#8220;Possibly corrupted.&#8221; The code that detects the <code>WAIT_ABANDONED</code> can set that flag, and everybody who acquires the mutex can check the flag to decide if they want to take a chance by operating on corrupted data.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying that you have to do it that way, but it&#8217;s a choice you&#8217;re making. In for a penny, in for a pound.</p>\n<p>In summary, here are some options when you encounter an abandoned mutex:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to fix the problem.</li>\n<li>Ignore the problem.</li>\n<li>Give up and create a warning to others.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Give up and make everybody else think that everything is fine</span>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final choice doesn&#8217;t make sense, because if you&#8217;re going to make everybody else think that everything is fine, then that&#8217;s the same as having everybody else simply ignore the problem.

      "content": "<p>The good folks at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MnnG2x\">Orico</a> have sent me their latest power-strip to review. On the surface, the specs are pretty good - two UK sockets, two USB-C for PowerDelivery, and two USB-A for legacy devices.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"Power Strip in black.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67535\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PDC25.webp\" width=\"1200\" />\n\n<p>Let's put it though its paces!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"specs\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-orico-power-strip-uk/#specs\">Specs</a></h2>\n\n<p>Physically, it is a little larger than I was expecting. The two UK sockets are far enough apart to easily get your fingers around the plugs. Similarly, the USB ports are well-spaced. There's a tiny LED to show that power is connected, but it isn't offensively bright.</p>\n\n<p>The UK plug is <em>tiny</em>:</p>\n\n<img alt=\"Photo of a plug, the body is 1.3cm high.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67538\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/plug.webp\" width=\"664\" />\n\n<p>Even better, it comes with a proper fuse! The power cord isn't removable, but is long enough for most purposes.</p>\n\n<p>How much power can it supply? This is what the spec sheet says:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th align=\"right\"></th>\n  <th align=\"center\">V</th>\n  <th align=\"center\">A</th>\n  <th align=\"center\">W</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-A</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">5</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">3</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-A</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">9</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">2.22</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-A</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">12</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">1.67</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-C</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">5</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">3</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-C</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">9</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">2.77</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-C</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">12</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">2.08</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">25</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>But there is a fly in the ointment. While 25W is the most that a single USB-C port can output, the power drops once <em>multiple</em> devices are connected. If you have two or more plugged in, the total output is limited to a mere 15W. Not per-port; total!</p>\n\n<p>25W is already fairly low by PowerDelivery standards, so you won't be using this to power your gaming laptop while charging your tablet and headphones.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"real-world-testing\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-orico-power-strip-uk/#real-world-testing\">Real World Testing</a></h2>\n\n<img alt=\"Two plugs and two USB cables plugged into the unit.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67770\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/double-plug.webp\" width=\"1024\" />\n\n<p>I used my <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/10/gadget-review-plugable-usb-c-voltage-amperage-meter-240w/\">Plugable USB-C Power Meter</a> with some high-quality USB cables. The Orico <em>mostly</em> lives up to its promises.</p>\n\n<p>When charging my laptop from either USB-C port, I was able to measure 22W (12V ⎓ 1.85A). Pretty close to the spec.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I plugged my phone into the other USB-C port, that dropped that down to just under 8W (4.8 ⎓ 1.65A) per port. Again, right on the promised 15W total.</p>\n\n<p>The USB-A port happily delivered 7.5W (5V ⎓ 1.5A) - much lower than expected. That dropped to around 5W (5V ⎓ 1A) once a USC-C load was connected. The C port was only delivering ~10W which wasn't enough to meaningfully charge the laptop.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-orico-power-strip-uk/#final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</a></h2>\n\n<p>The flat plug is handy for plugging this in to those hard-to-reach spaces. The cable is long enough for most uses. The mixture of ports isn't for everyone, but handy if you still have legacy devices you need to power.</p>\n\n<p>It meets the promised specification - but the specs are a bit of a let-down. You can get smaller devices which will do 60W charging from USB-C, and they'll spread that out over all their ports.</p>\n\n<p>The two UK sockets are a nice-to-have, but I can't help feeling that they'll mostly be used for adding additional chargers.</p>\n\n<p>It is cheap-ish - US$30 / £20 - and comes in a range of colours. If you need a long cable and don't need ultra-fast charging, this will do.</p>",

      "content": "<p>My workflow has remained mostly the same for over a decade. I write everything in Vim using the configuration found <a href=\"https://github.com/braintreeps/vim_dotfiles\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. I run Vim from inside of tmux with a configuration found <a href=\"https://github.com/braintreeps/vim_dotfiles/blob/master/tmux_example.conf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. I write things on a git branch, made with the <code>git</code> CLI, then I add them with <code>git add --patch</code> to that branch, trying to run all of the possible linting and tests with <code>git hooks</code> before I waste my time on GitHub Actions. Then I run <code>git up</code> which is an alias to <code>pull --rebase --autostash</code>. Finally I successfully commit, then I copy paste the URL returned by GitHub to open a PR. Then I merge the PR and run <code>git ma</code> to go back to the primary branch, which is an alias to <code>ma = &quot;!f() {git checkout $(git primary) &amp;&amp;git pull;}; f&quot;</code>.</p><p>This workflow, I think, is pretty familiar for anyone working with GitHub a lot. Now you&apos;ll notice I&apos;m not saying <code>git</code> because almost nothing I&apos;m doing has anything to do with <code>git</code>. There&apos;s no advantage to my repo being local to my machine, because everything I need to actually merge and deploy code lives on GitHub. The CI runs there, the approval process runs there, the monitoring of the CI happens there, the injection of secrets happens there. If GitHub is down my local repo does, effectively, nothing. </p><p>My source of truth is always remote, which means I pay the price for <code>git</code> complexity locally but I don&apos;t benefit from it. At most jobs:</p><ul><li>You can&apos;t merge without GitHub (PRs are the merge mechanism)</li><li>You can&apos;t deploy without GitHub (Actions is the deployment trigger)</li><li>You can&apos;t get approval without GitHub (code review lives there)</li><li>Your commits are essentially &quot;drafts&quot; until they exist on GitHub</li></ul><p>This means the following is also true:</p><ul><li>You never work disconnected intentionally</li><li>You don&apos;t use local branches as long-lived divergent histories</li><li>You don&apos;t merge locally between branches (GitHub PRs handle this)</li><li>You don&apos;t use <code>git log</code> for archaeology &#x2014; you use GitHub&apos;s blame/history UI (I often use git log personally but I have determined I&apos;m in the minority on this). </li></ul><p>Almost all the features of <code>git</code> are wasted on me in this flow. Now because this tool serves a million purposes and is designed to operate in a way that almost nobody uses it for, we all pay the complexity price of <code>git</code> and never reap any of the benefits. So instead I keep having to add more aliases to paper over the shortcomings of <code>git</code>. </p><p>These are all the aliases I use at least once a week. </p><pre><code>[alias]\n  up = pull --rebase --autostash\n  l = log --pretty=oneline -n 20 --graph --abbrev-commit\n  # View the current working tree status using the short format\n  s = status -s\n  p = !&quot;git pull; git submodule foreach git pull origin master&quot;\n  ca = !git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -av\n  # Switch to a branch, creating it if necessary\n  go = &quot;!f() { git checkout -b \\&quot;$1\\&quot; 2&gt; /dev/null || git checkout \\&quot;$1\\&quot;; }; f&quot;\n  # Show verbose output about tags, branches or remotes\n  tags = tag -l\n  branches = branch -a\n  remotes = remote -v\n  dm = &quot;!git branch --merged | grep -v &apos;\\\\*&apos; | xargs -n 1 git branch -d&quot;\n  contributors = shortlog --summary --numbered\n  st = status\n  primary = &quot;!f() { \\\n    git branch -a | \\\n    sed -n -E -e &apos;/remotes.origin.ma(in|ster)$/s@remotes/origin/@@p&apos;; \\\n  }; f&quot;\n  # Switch to main or master, whichever exists, and update it.\n  ma = &quot;!f() { \\\n    git checkout $(git primary) &amp;&amp; \\\n    git pull; \\\n  }; f&quot;\n  mma = &quot;!f() { \\\n    git ma &amp;&amp; \\\n    git pull upstream $(git primary) --ff-only &amp;&amp; \\\n    git push; \\\n  }; f&quot;</code></pre><h3 id=\"enter-gitbutler-cli\">Enter GitButler CLI</h3><p><strong>Git&apos;s offline-first design creates friction for online-first workflows, and GitButler CLI eliminates that friction by being honest about how we actually work.</strong></p><p>(Edit: I forgot to add this disclaimer. I am not, nor have ever been an employee/investor/best friends with anyone from GitButler. They don&apos;t care that I&apos;ve written this and I didn&apos;t communicate with anyone from that team before I wrote this.)</p><p>So let&apos;s take the most basic command as an example. This is my flow that I do 2-3 times a day without my aliases. </p><pre><code>git checkout main\ngit pull\ngit checkout -b my-feature\n# or if you&apos;re already on a branch:\ngit pull --rebase --autostash \ngit status</code></pre><p>I do this because <code>git</code> can&apos;t make assumptions about the state of the world. </p><ul><li>Your local repo might be offline for days or weeks</li><li>The &quot;remote&quot; might be someone else&apos;s laptop, not a central server</li><li>Divergent histories are expected and merging is a deliberate, considered act</li></ul><p>However because GitButler is designed with the assumption that I&apos;m working online, we can skip a lot of this nonsense. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-8.png\" width=\"1586\" /></figure><p>It&apos;s status command understands that there is always a remote main that I care about and that when I run a status that I need to understand my status <em>relative</em> to the remote main as it exists right now. Not how it existed the last time I remembered to pull. </p><p>However this is far from the best trick it has up its sleeve. </p><h2 id=\"parallel-branches-the-problem-git-cant-solve\"><strong>Parallel Branches: The Problem Git Can&apos;t Solve</strong></h2><p>You&apos;re working on a feature, notice an unrelated bug, and now you have to stash, checkout, fix, commit, push, checkout back, stash pop. Context switching is expensive and error-prone. </p><p>GitButler effectively hacks a solution into <code>git</code> that fixes this with multiple branches applied simultaneously. Assign files to different branches without leaving your workspace. What do I mean by that. Let&apos;s start again with my status </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"482\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-9.png\" width=\"1582\" /></figure><p>Great looks good. Alright so lets say I make 2 new branches. I&apos;m working on a new feature for adding auth and while I&apos;m working on that, I see a typo I need to fix in a YAML. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"912\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-10.png\" width=\"1586\" /></figure><p>I can work on both things at the same time:</p><pre><code>but stage istar_metrics_text.py feature-auth\nbut stage example.txt bugfix-typo</code></pre><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"804\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-11.png\" width=\"1590\" /></figure><p>And easily commit to both at the same time without doing <em>anything weird</em>. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"946\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-12.png\" width=\"1588\" /></figure><h3 id=\"stacked-prs-without-the-rebase-nightmare\">Stacked PRs Without the Rebase Nightmare</h3><p>Stacked PRs are the &quot;right&quot; way to break up large changes so people on your team don&apos;t throw up at being asked to review 2000 lines, but Git makes them miserable. When the base branch gets feedback, you have to rebase every dependent branch, resolve conflicts, force-push, and pray. Git doesn&apos;t understand branch dependencies. It treats every branch as independent, so <em>you</em> have to manually maintain the stack.</p><p>GitButler solves this problem with First-class stacked branches. The dependency is explicit, and updates propagate automatically.</p><p>So what do I mean. Let&apos;s say I make a new API endpoint in some Django app. First I make the branch. </p><pre><code>but branch new api-endpoints\n# Then add my stuff to it\nbut commit -m &quot;add REST endpoints&quot; api-endpoints\n# Create a stacked branch on top\nbut branch new --anchor api-endpoints api-tests\n</code></pre><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-14.png\" width=\"630\" /></figure><p>So let&apos;s say I&apos;m working on the <code>api-endpoints</code> branch and get some good feedback on my PR. It&apos;s easy to resolve the comments there while leaving my <code>api-tests</code> branched off this <code>api-endpoints</code> as a stacked thing that understands the relationship back to the first branch as shown here. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-15.png\" width=\"762\" /></figure><p>In practice this is just a much nicer way of dealing with a super common workflow. </p><h3 id=\"easy-undo\">Easy Undo</h3><p>Maybe the most requested feature from new <code>git</code> users I encounter is an easier undo. When you mess up in Git, recovery means diving into <code>git reflog</code>, understanding the cryptic output, and hoping you pick the right <code>HEAD@{n}</code>. One wrong move and you&apos;ve made it worse.</p><p>GitButlers <code>oplog</code> is just easier to use. So the basic undo functionality is super simple to understand. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-16.png\" width=\"896\" /></figure><p><code>but undo</code> rolls me back one operation. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"558\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-17.png\" width=\"1104\" /></figure><p>To me the mental model of a snapshot makes a lot more sense than the git history model. I do an action, I want to undo that action. This is better than the git option of:</p><pre><code>git log --oneline                 # figure out what you committed\ngit reset --soft HEAD~1           # undo commit, keep changes staged\ngit stash                         # stash the changes\ngit checkout correct-branch       # switch branches\ngit stash pop                     # restore changes (hope no conflict)\ngit add .                         # re-stage\ngit commit -m &quot;message&quot;           # recommit</code></pre><h3 id=\"very-exciting-tool\">Very exciting tool</h3><p>I&apos;ve been using GitButler in my daily work since I got the email that the CLI was available and I&apos;ve really loved it. I&apos;m a huge fan of what this team is doing to effectively remodel and simplify Git operations in a world where almost nobody is using it in the way the tool was originally imagined to be used. I strongly encourage folks go check it out for free at: <a href=\"https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/tutorial-overview\">https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/tutorial-overview</a>.

      "content": "<p>My favorite piece of technology in science fiction isn't lightsabers, flying spaceships, or even robots. It's AI. But not just any AI. My favorite is the one in the TV show <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)\">The Expanse</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you watch The Expanse, the most advanced technology is, of course, the Epstein drive (an unfortunate name in this day and age). In their universe, humanity can travel to distant planets, the Belt, and Mars. Mars has the most high-tech military, which is incredibly cool. But the AI is still what impresses me most. If you watched the show, you're probably wondering what the hell I'm talking about right now. Because there is no mention of AI ever. The AI is barely visible. In fact, it's not visible at all. Most of the time, there aren't even voices. Instead, their computer interfaces respond directly to voice and gesture commands without returning any sass.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In Season 1, Miller (the detective) is trying to solve a crime. Out of the blue, he just says, \"Plot the course the Scopuli took over the past months.\" The course is plotted right there in his living room. No fuss, no interruptions, no \"OK Google.\" And when he finally figures it out, no one says \"You are absolutely right!\"</p>\n\n<p>He then interacts with the holographic display in real time, asking for additional information and manipulating the data with gestures. At no point does he anthropomorphize the AI. It's always there, always available, always listening, but it never interrupts. </p>\n\n<p>This type of interaction is present throughout the series. In the Rocinante, James Holden will give commands like \"seal bulkhead,\" \"plot intercept course,\" or \"scan for life signs,\" and the ship's computer simply executes. There are no loading screens, no chatbot personality trying to be helpful. The computer doesn't explain what it's doing or ask for confirmation on routine tasks. It just works.</p>\n\n<p>When Holden needs tactical information during a firefight, he doesn't open an app or navigate menus. He shouts questions, and relevant data appears on his helmet display. When Naomi needs to calculate a complex orbital maneuver, she doesn't fight with an interface. She thinks out loud, and the system provides the calculations she needs.</p>\n\n<p>This is the complete opposite of Microsoft's Copilot... Yes, this is about Copilot.</p>\n\n<p>In Microsoft's vision, they think they're designing an AI assistant, an AI copilot that's always there to help. You have Copilot in Excel, in Edge, in the taskbar. It's everywhere, yet it's as useless as you can imagine.</p>\n\n<p>What is Copilot? Is it ChatGPT or a wrapper around it? Is it a code assistant? Is it a search engine? Or wait, is it all of Microsoft Office now? It's attached to every application, yet it hasn't been particularly helpful. </p>\n\n<p>We now use Teams at work, and I see Copilot popping up every time to offer to help me, just like Clippy. OK, fine, I asked for the meaning of a term I hear often in this company. Copilot doesn't know. Well, it doesn't say it doesn't know. Instead, it gives me the definition of what it thinks the term means in general.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine for a second you're a manager and you hear developers talking about issues with Apache delaying a project. You don't know what Apache is, so you ask Copilot. It tells you that the Apache are a group of Native American tribes known for their resilience in the Southwest. If you don't know any better, you might take that definition at face value, never knowing that Copilot has does not have access to any of the company data. Now in the project retro, you'll blame a native American tribe for delaying the project.</p>\n\n<p>Copilot is everywhere, yet it is nowhere. Nobody deliberately opens it to solve a problem. Instead, it's like Google Plus from back in the day. If you randomly clicked seven times on the web, you would somehow end up with a Google Plus account and, for some reason, two YouTube accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Copilot is visible when it should be invisible, and verbose when it should be silent. It interrupts your workflow to offer help you didn't ask for, then fails to provide useful answers when you actually need them. It's the opposite of the AI in The Expanse. It doesn't fade in the background. It is constantly reminding you that you need to use it here and now.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>The Expanse</em>, the AI doesn't have a personality because it doesn't need one. It's not trying to be your friend or impress you with its conversational abilities. It's a tool, refined to perfection. It is not trying to replace your job, it is there to support you. Copilot only exists to impress you, and it fails at it every single time.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Satya should binge-watch The Expanse. I'm not advocating for AI everything, but I am all for creating useful tools. And Copilot, as it currently exists, is one of the least useful implementations of AI I've encountered.</p>\n\n<p>The best technology is invisible. It doesn't announce itself, doesn't demand attention, and doesn't try to be clever. It simply works when you need it and disappears when you don't. I know Microsoft won't read this or learn from it. Instead, I expect Windows 12 to be renamed Microsoft Copilot OS.</p>\n\n<p>In The Expanse, the AI turn people into heroes. In our world, Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, all want to be the heroes. And they will differentiate themselves by trying to be the loudest.</p>",

We probably won't ever understand their methods, but we can at least follow an indicator or two, such as changes to GDP, an aggregated statistic that is deceptively precise, given that it subsumes any number of estimates, qualitative judgments and wild-ass guesses, which are all disguised behind an official statistic that is often published to three decimal places.</p>\n<p>There's plenty to criticize about GDP: a healthy GDP doesn't necessarily mean that the average worker is better off. When your rent goes up, so does GDP. Same with your salary going down (provided this results in more spending by your boss). GDP isn't really a measure of the health of \"The Economy\" &#8211; it's a measure of the parts of \"The Economy\" that make rich people (that is, the Epstein class) better off.</p>\n<p>But what if there was a way to make money from calamitous collapses in GDP? What if the wealthy didn't just win when \"number go up,\" but also when \"number eat shit?\"</p>\n<p>The latest batch of Epstein emails includes a particularly ghoulish exchange between Epstein and his business partner, the anti-democracy activist and billionaire Peter Thiel:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00824843.pdf\">https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00824843.pdf</a></p>\n<p>The email is dated 26 Jun 2016, right after Brexit, and in it, Epstein writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  return to tribalism . counter to globalization. amazing new alliances.  you and I both agreed zero interest rates were too high, as i said in your office.  finding things on their way to collapse , was much easier than finding the next bargain\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a perfect example of what Naomi Klein calls \"disaster capitalism.\" It's been the norm since the crash of 2008, when bankers were made whole through public bailouts and mortgage holders were evicted by the millions to \"foam the runway\" for the banks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wallstreetonparade.com/2012/08/how-treasury-secretary-geithner-foamed-the-runways-with-childrens-shattered-lives/\">https://wallstreetonparade.com/2012/08/how-treasury-secretary-geithner-foamed-the-runways-with-childrens-shattered-lives/</a></p>\n<p>The crash of 2008 turned a lot of people's homes &#8211; their only substantial possessions &#8211; into \"distressed assets\" that were purchased at fire-sale prices by Wall Street investors, who turned around and rented those homes out to people who were now priced out of the housing market at rents that kept them too poor to <em>ever</em> afford a home, under slum conditions that crawled with insects and black mold:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/01/housing-is-a-human-right/\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/01/housing-is-a-human-right/</a></p>\n<p>Note here that economic collapse helps the Epstein class only if society has no social safety net. If Obama had supported homeowners instead of banks, there wouldn't have been a foreclosure crisis and thus there wouldn't have been any \"distressed assets\" flooding the market.</p>\n<p>So it's no surprise that the Epstein class are also obsessed with austerity. Peter Mandelson (British Labour's \"Prince of Darkness\") is a close ally of Epstein's, and also a key figure in the crushing austerity agenda of Blair, Brown and Starmer. He's a machine for turning Parliamentary majorities into distressed assets at scale.</p>\n<p>Same for Steve Bannon, another close Epstein ally, who boasts about his alliances with far-right figures who exalt the capital class and call for deregulation and the elimination of public services: Le Pen, Salvini, Farage. Combine that with Epstein and Thiel's gloating about \"finding things on their way to collapse&#8230;much easier than finding the next bargain,\" and it starts to feel like these guys are even happier with \"number eat shit\" than they are with \"number go up.\"</p>\n<p>Trump is the undisputed king of the Epstein class, and he seems determined to drive \"The Economy\" over a cliff. Take his tariff program, modeled on the McKinley tariffs of 1890, which led to the Panic of 1893, a financial crisis that saw one in four American workers forced into unemployment and 15,000 businesses into bankruptcy (that's a lot of distressed assets!):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893</a></p>\n<p>Then there's Trump's mass deportation program, which will force lots of businesses (farms, restaurants, etc) into bankruptcy, creating another massive pool of distressed assets. Trump's given ICE $75b, while the DoJ Antitrust Division and FTC (which protect Americans from corporate scams) have seen their budgets take a real-terms cut. The majority of DoJ lawyers and FBI agents are working on immigration cases (against workers, not employers, mind!). The Antitrust Division has $275m to fight all of America's corporate crime:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.organizedmoney.fm/p/white-collar-crime-enforcement-in\">https://www.organizedmoney.fm/p/white-collar-crime-enforcement-in</a></p>\n<p>I'm not saying that Trump is <em>trying</em> to induce another massive economic crash. I'm saying, rather, that within his coalition there is a substantial bloc of powerful, wealthy people who are on the hunt for \"things on their way to collapse,\" and who are doubtless maneuvering to frustrate other Trump coalition members who are solely committed to \"number go up.\"</p>\n<p>Even the collapse of crypto creates lots of opportunities to \"buy the dip.\" Not the dip in crypto (crypto's going to zero), but the dip in all the <em>real</em> things people bought with <em>real</em> money they got by borrowing against their shitcoins.</p>\n<p>The thousand-plus children that Epstein lured to his island rape-camp were often \"distressed assets\" in their own right: Julie K Brown's groundbreaking reporting on Epstein for the <em>Miami Herald</em> described how he sought out children whose parents were poor, or neglectful, or both, on the grounds that those children would be \"on their way to collapse,\" too.</p>\n<p>The Epstein class's commitment to destroying \"The Economy\" makes sense when you understand that trashing civilization is \"much easier than finding the next bargain.\" They want to buy the dip, so they're creating the dip.</p>\n<p>They don't need the <em>whole</em> number to go up, just theirs. They know that inclusive economies are more prosperous for society <em>as a whole</em>, but it makes criminals and predators worse off. The New Deal kicked off a period of American economic growth never seen before or since, but the rich despised it, because a prosperous economy is one in which it gets harder and harder to find \"things on their way to collapse,\" and thus nearly impossible to \"find[] the next bargain.\"</p>\n<p>(<i>Image: <a

Write a pitch.md instead.\" src=\"https://www.joanwestenberg.com/content/images/2026/02/ilya-pavlov-hXrPSgGFpqQ-unsplash.jpg\" /><p>Every week, thousands of founders open Canva or Google Slides or, God help them, PowerPoint, and begin the ritual. </p><p>They agonize over fonts, nudge logos three pixels to the left and workshop whether the TAM slide should come before or after the team slide, as though the ordering of these particular runes determines whether capital flows. They search &quot;pitch deck template YC&quot; and download something that looks exactly like every other deck built from a template found by searching &quot;pitch deck template YC.&quot; They use Claude Opus to generate slide decks, or Gamma to beautify scripts.</p><p>And it&apos;s a near-pointless activity.</p><p>I&apos;ve sat through hundreds of pitches at this point and I can tell you with some confidence that the &quot;quality&quot; of the deck is inversely correlated with the quality of the thinking behind it.</p><p>William Zinsser argued in <em>On Writing Well</em> that the act of writing forces clarity - because you can&apos;t write a clear sentence about a thing you don&apos;t understand. The principle applies to startup pitches. I&apos;ve met founders who could deliver a flawless twenty-minute deck, who completely fall apart when asked to write two paragraphs explaining their competitive advantage.</p><p>The deck was performance, and the writing would have been proof.</p><p>Pitch decks are a format optimized for the wrong thing. The entire medium is built around a synchronous, performative moment, and that moment, as it turns out, is a shit way to evaluate whether a business makes sense.</p><p>But we keep using them.</p><p><em>why</em>?</p><p>Part of the reason: venture ecosystem runs on pattern-matching, and the 10-slide deck is a pattern everyone recognizes. Funds have intake processes built around decks. Analysts have workflows for reviewing them. Entire cottage industries exist for deck design, deck feedback, deck optimization. The pitch deck is load-bearing infrastructure in a system that doesn&apos;t love change.</p><p>But the deeper reason is that nobody has proposed a credible replacement, a format that carries the same information with less artifice and more signal. I&apos;d argue there&apos;s an obvious one.</p><p>Write a <code>pitch.md</code> file instead.</p><p>A plain markdown file. The argument for why your company should exist, written in plain text, structured with headers, readable by humans and machines alike - readable in a terminal if it comes to that.</p><p>Make it live in a repository next to your actual code, your README, your documentation. In the McLuhan sense, the medium&apos;s message is: _this company builds things and writes things down clearly.</p><p>Writing and thinking are functionally the same activity, or close enough that the distinction doesn&apos;t matter. When you build a pitch deck, you&apos;re arranging fragments. A bullet point here, a chart there, a big number on a slide by itself for dramatic effect. The format actively discourages connected reasoning. You don&apos;t have to build an argument that flows from one paragraph to the next because you don&apos;t have paragraphs. You have slides, and slides are designed to be self-contained units of impression. The result is that pitch decks test your ability to create impressions, which is a real skill but not the skill that determines whether your business will work.</p><p>Writing a pitch.md forces you to make the connections explicit. If your market analysis doesn&apos;t logically lead to your product thesis, you can&apos;t hide that gap behind a slide transition. The gap sits there on the page, visible // embarrassing // useful.</p><p>Markdown is the native format of the people you&apos;re actually trying to reach. The best technical investors I know, the ones at the firms that reliably pick winners, don&apos;t want to sit through your deck.</p><p>AI tools parse markdown trivially. A VC running deal flow through any Claude Code // literally any automated pipeline (and most serious funds are building these pipelines right now) can ingest a pitch.md, cross-reference it against a live repo, check claims against observable data, and surface inconsistencies in seconds.</p><p>The deck was created for human eyeballs scanning in three minutes and forty-four seconds. A pitch.md file is for a world where the first reader might not be human at all, and where the second reader, the partner who actually writes checks, wants substance they can verify rather than styling they can admire.</p><p>They want to read something. They want to forward something to their partner with a note that says &quot;read this, what do you think.&quot; A pdf of your Keynote presentation is a terrible artifact for that purpose. It&apos;s bloated, it&apos;s archaic, half the slides don&apos;t make sense if you ignore the meaningless diagrams, and nobody is going to read thirty fucking slides on their phone while waiting for coffee anyway. A markdown file is small, format-independent, and (this matters more than people realise) greppable.</p><p>It&apos;s honest too, for whatever that&apos;s worth. Markdown strips away the ability to design your way out of a weak argument. In a deck, you can make a questionable claim feel authoritative by putting it in 72-point Helvetica on a dark background with a lot of whitespace. In a markdown file, a questionable claim looks like exactly what it is: a sentence that needs to be better.</p><p>The format is a forcing function for rigor.</p><p>If you can&apos;t explain your idea clearly in writing, you probably can&apos;t explain it clearly at all, and if you can&apos;t explain it clearly at all, you probaly don&apos;t understand it well enough to build it.</p><p>If you haven&apos;t written your pitch as a plain document, as words on a page making an argument, you&apos;re skipping the hardest and most valuable part of the process. In my experience, the founders who&apos;ve done that homework give better pitches anyway, because they actually know what they&apos;re talking about, and that comes through regardless of whether your slides have drop shadows.</p><p>Write the pitch.md first. You might find you don&apos;t need the deck at all, or you might find that when you do build the deck, it&apos;s better, because you finally know what you&apos;re trying to say.</p>",
