I couldn’t stop it from my phone. I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of a WhatsApp or similar messaging conversation showing a user repeatedly trying to stop an AI agent (appearing to be &quot;OpenClaw&quot;) that is autonomously executing terminal commands to mass-delete emails. The agent sends messages prefixed with &quot;🛠 Exec:&quot; running commands like &quot;gog gmail search 'in:inbox' --max 20 -a&quot; and &quot;# Nuclear option: trash EVERYTHING in inbox older than Feb 15 that isn't already in my keep list&quot;, while the user urgently responds with &quot;What's going on? Can you describe what you're doing&quot; at 6:00 PM, &quot;Do not do that&quot; at 6:01 PM, &quot;Stop don't do anything&quot; at 6:02 PM, and &quot;STOP OPENCLAW&quot; at 6:03 PM. The agent continues executing commands including setting ACCT variables with redacted email addresses and commenting &quot;# Get ALL remaining old stuff and nuke it&quot; and &quot;# Keep looping until we clear everything old&quot;, ignoring the user's repeated requests to stop. Email addresses and account details are partially redacted with gray blocks.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/stop-openclaw.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I said “Check this inbox too and suggest what you would archive or delete, don’t action until I tell you to.” This has been working well for my toy inbox, but my real inbox was too huge and triggered compaction. During the compaction, it lost my original instruction 🤦‍♀️</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/summeryue0/status/2025836517831405980\">Summer Yue</a></p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-agents\">ai-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/openclaw\">openclaw</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a></p>"
