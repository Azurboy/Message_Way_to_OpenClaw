Here's an example of a response: tldraw, the outstanding collaborative drawing library (see <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/16/tldrawdraw-a-ui/\">previous coverage</a>), are moving their test suite to a private repository - apparently in response to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/\">Cloudflare's project to port Next.js to use Vite in a week using AI</a>.</p>\n<p>They also filed a joke issue, now closed to <a href=\"https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/8092\">Translate source code to Traditional Chinese</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The current tldraw codebase is in English, making it easy for external AI coding agents to replicate. It is imperative that we defend our intellectual property.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Worth noting that tldraw aren't technically open source - their <a href=\"https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme\">custom license</a> requires a commercial license if you want to use it in \"production environments\".\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/2026581824428753211\">@steveruizok</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/open-source\">open-source</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/cloudflare\">cloudflare</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a></p>"
