So why did we leave to start another\nweather company?</p>\n\n<p>It’s simple: when looking at the landscape of the countless\nweather apps out there, many of them lovely, we found ourselves\nfeeling unsatisfied. The more we spoke to friends and family, the\nmore we heard that many of them did too. And, of course, we missed\nthose days as a small scrappy shop.</p>\n\n<p>So let’s try this again…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Acme Weather is a solid 1.0. Its main innovation is a timeline graph of alternative forecasts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>First, the spread of the lines offers a sort of intuition as to\nhow reliable the forecast is. Take the two forecasts below. In the\nfirst, the alternate predictions are tightly focused and the\nforecast can be considered robust and reliable. In the second,\nthere is a significant spread, which is an indication that\nsomething is up and the forecast may be subject to change. It’s a\ncall to action to check other conditions or maps, or come back to\nthe app more frequently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/24/acme-weather\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Acme Weather’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"
