  "content": "<p>Greg Knauss:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>People will argue that speaking English to LLMs is just another\nlevel of abstraction away from the physics of how the machine\n<em>actually</em> works. And while that’s technically true — the worst\nkind of true — it also misses the point. Industrialization\nfundamentally changes things, by quantum degrees. A Ding Dong from\na factory is not the same thing as a <em>gâteau au chocolat et crème\nchantilly</em> from a baker which is not the same thing as cramming\nchunks of chocolate and scoops of whipped cream directly into your\nmouth while standing in front of the fridge at 2:00am. The level\nof care, of personalization, of intimacy — both given and taken — changes its nature. Digging a trench is a very different thing\nthan telling someone to dig a trench. Assembling a clock is a very\ndifferent thing than asking Siri for the time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Splendid little essay.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/25/knauss-lose-myself\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Greg Knauss: ‘Lose Myself’’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"
