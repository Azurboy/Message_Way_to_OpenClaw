Both are multi-modal for vision input.</p>\n<p>The open weight one is a Mixture of Experts model called Qwen3.5-397B-A17B. Interesting to see Qwen call out serving efficiency as a benefit of that architecture:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Built on an innovative hybrid architecture that fuses linear attention (via Gated Delta Networks) with a sparse mixture-of-experts, the model attains remarkable inference efficiency: although it comprises 397 billion total parameters, just 17 billion are activated per forward pass, optimizing both speed and cost without sacrificing capability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B\">807GB on Hugging Face</a>, and Unsloth have a <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-GGUF\">collection of smaller GGUFs</a> ranging in size from 94.2GB 1-bit to 462GB Q8_K_XL.</p>\n<p>I got this <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/\">pelican</a> from the <a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b\">OpenRouter hosted model</a> (<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/625546cf6b371f9c0040e64492943b82\">transcript</a>):</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Pelican is quite good although the neck lacks an outline for some reason. Bicycle is very basic with an incomplete frame\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen3.5-397b-a17b.png\" /></p>\n<p>The proprietary hosted model is called Qwen3.5 Plus 2026-02-15, and is a little confusing. Qwen researcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinLin610/status/2023340126479569140\">Junyang Lin  says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Qwen3-Plus is a hosted API version of 397B. As the model natively supports 256K tokens, Qwen3.5-Plus supports 1M token context length. Additionally it supports search and code interpreter, which you can use on Qwen Chat with Auto mode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/9507dd47483f78dc1195117735273e20\">its pelican</a>, which is similar in quality to the open weights model:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Similar quality pelican. The bicycle is taller and has a better frame shape. They are visually quite similar.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen3.5-plus-02-15.png\" />\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/vision-llms\">vision-llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/qwen\">qwen</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle\">pelican-riding-a-bicycle</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm-release\">llm-release</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/openrouter\">openrouter</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-in-china\">ai-in-china</a></p>"
