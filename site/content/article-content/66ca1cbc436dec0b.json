Unfortunately as of 2025-11-22, these are being\n  heavily abused by aggressive web crawlers and other automated software.\n  Your software has been redirected to this special single-entry feed\n  so that you can hopefully find out about this and ideally remedy it.\n  Please see\n  <a href=\"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/cspace-gen-http429.html\">my\n  general web page on limited network areas</a>.\n  </p>\n  <p>I am willing to exempt at least some feed readers from this\n  restriction. See the page above for details on how to contact me to\n  arrange this.\n  </p>"
