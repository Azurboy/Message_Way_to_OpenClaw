He is a genius with a lot of amazing ideas\nabout the future of very smart agents interacting with each other\nto do very useful things for people. We expect this will quickly\nbecome core to our product offerings.</p>\n\n<p>OpenClaw will live in a foundation as an open source project that\nOpenAI will continue to support. The future is going to be\nextremely multi-agent and it’s important to us to support open\nsource as part of that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m sure it will remain as open as the “open” in OpenAI’s own name.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/24/open-ai-openclaw-open-all-the-way-down\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘OpenAI Acquired OpenClaw and Hired Peter Steinberger’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"
