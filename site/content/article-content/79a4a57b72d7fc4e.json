Biological mum Tīwhiri has four fertile eggs this season already, while Yasmine, an experienced foster mum, had no fertile eggs.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And an <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/digs.bsky.social/post/3mf25glzt2c2b\">update from conservation biologist Andrew Digby</a> - a second chick hatched this morning!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second #kakapo chick of the #kakapo2026 breeding season hatched this morning: Hine Taumai-A1-2026 on Ako's nest on Te Kākahu. We transferred the egg from Anchor two nights ago. This is Ako's first-ever chick, which is just a few hours old in this video.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That post <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/digs.bsky.social/post/3mf25glzt2c2b\">has a video</a> of mother and chick.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A beautiful charismatic green Kākāp feeding a little grey chick\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/kakapo-plus-chick.jpg\" />\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://www.metafilter.com/212231/Happy-Valen-Kkp-Tines\">MetaFilter</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/kakapo\">kakapo</a></p>"
