  "content": "<p>My thanks to Sentry for sponsoring last week at DF. Sentry is running a hands-on workshop: “<a href=\"https://sentry.io/resources/ios-workshop-jan-2026/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=paid-display&amp;utm_campaign=general-fy27q1-evergreen&amp;utm_content=static-ad-mobilerss-trysentry\">Crash Reporting, Tracing, and Logs for iOS in Sentry</a>”. You can watch it on demand. You’ll learn how to connect the dots between slowdowns, crashes, and the user experience in your iOS app. It’ll show you how to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Set up Sentry to surface high-priority mobile issues without alert fatigue.</li>\n<li>Use Logs and Breadcrumbs to reconstruct what happened with a crash.</li>\n<li>Find what’s behind a performance bottleneck using Tracing.</li>\n<li>Monitor and reduce the size of your iOS app using Size Analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/22/sentry\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Sentry’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"
