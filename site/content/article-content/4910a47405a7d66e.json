It started back in 2021 as <a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/compat2021\">Compat 2021</a> before being rebranded to Interop <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2022/03/03/microsoft-edge-and-interop-2022/\">in 2022</a>.</p>\n<p>The dashboards for each year can be seen here, and they demonstrate how wildly effective the program has been: <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2021\">2021</a>, <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2022\">2022</a>, <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023\">2023</a>, <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024\">2024</a>, <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2025\">2025</a>, <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2026\">2026</a>.</p>\n<p>Here's the progress chart for 2025, which shows every browser vendor racing towards a 95%+ score by the end of the year:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Line chart showing Interop 2025 browser compatibility scores over the year (Jan–Dec) for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Interop. Y-axis ranges from 0% to 100%. Chrome (yellow) and Edge (green) lead, starting around 80% and reaching near 100% by Dec. Firefox (orange) starts around 48% and climbs to ~98%. Safari (blue) starts around 45% and reaches ~96%. The Interop line (dark green/black) starts lowest around 29% and rises to ~95% by Dec. All browsers converge near 95–100% by year's end.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/interop-2025.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The feature I'm most excited about in 2026 is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using#basic_mpa_view_transition\">Cross-document View Transitions</a>, building on the successful 2025 target of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using\">Same-Document View Transitions</a>. This will provide fancy SPA-style transitions between pages on websites with no JavaScript at all.</p>\n<p>As a keen WebAssembly tinkerer I'm also intrigued by this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-promise-integration/blob/main/proposals/js-promise-integration/Overview.md\">JavaScript Promise Integration for Wasm</a> allows WebAssembly to asynchronously 'suspend', waiting on the result of an external promise. This simplifies the compilation of languages like C/C++ which expect APIs to run synchronously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/browsers\">browsers</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/css\">css</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/javascript\">javascript</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/web-standards\">web-standards</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/webassembly\">webassembly</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/jake-archibald\">jake-archibald</a></p>"
