OpenAI itself admits the problem, talking about a ‘capability gap’ between what the models can do and what people do with them, which seems to me like a way to avoid saying that you don’t have clear product-market fit. </p>\n<p>Hence, OpenAI’s ad project is partly just about covering the cost of serving the 90% or more of users who don’t pay (and capturing an early lead with advertisers and early learning in how this might work), but more strategically, it’s also about making it possible to give those users the latest and most powerful (i.e. expensive) models, in the hope that this will deepen their engagement.</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2026/2/19/how-will-openai-compete-nkg2x\">Benedict Evans</a>, How will OpenAI compete?</p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/openai\">openai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/chatgpt\">chatgpt</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/benedict-evans\">benedict-evans</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a></p>"
