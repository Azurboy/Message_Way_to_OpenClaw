What can the opposition party do without majorities in either house? Well, they could start by refusing to continue to fund ICE, a masked thug snatch/murder squad that roams our streets, killing with impunity:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273\">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273</a></p>\n<p>That's table stakes. What would a <em>real</em> political response to fascism look like? Again, it wouldn't stop with banning masks for ICE goons, or even requiring them to wear QR codes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345\">https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345</a></p>\n<p>Though it should be noted that ICE hates this idea, and that ICE agents wear masks because they fear consequences for their sadistic criminality:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/0LNh8\">https://archive.is/0LNh8</a></p>\n<p>This despite the fact that the (criminally culpable) Vice President has assured them that they have absolute impunity, no matter who they kill:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis\">https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis</a></p>\n<p>The fact that ICE agents worry about consequences despite Vance's assurances suggests ways that Dems could \"meet the moment.\"</p>\n<p>I think Dems should start a Nuremberg Caucus, named for the Nazi war-crimes trials that followed from the defeat of German fascists and the death of their leader:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials</a></p>\n<p>What would this caucus do? Well, it could have a public website where it assembled and organized the evidence for the trials that the Democrats could promise to bring after the Trump regime falls. Each fresh outrage, each statement, each video-clip &#8211; whether of Trump officials or of his shock-troops &#8211; could be neatly slotted in, given an exhibit number, and annotated with the criminal and civil violations captured in the evidence.</p>\n<p>The caucus could publish dates these trials will be held on &#8211; following from Jan 20, 2029 &#8211; and even which courtrooms each official, high and low, will be tried in. These dates could be changed as new crimes emerge, making sure the most egregious offenses are always at the top of the agenda. Each trial would have a witness list.</p>\n<p>The Nuremberg Caucus could vow to repurpose ICE's $75b budget to pursue Trump's crimes, from corruption to civil rights violations to labor violations to environmental violations. It could announce its intent to fully fund the FTC and DoJ Antitrust Division to undertake scrutiny of all mergers approved under Trump, and put corporations on notice that they should expect lengthy, probing inquiries into any mergers they undertake between now and the fall of Trumpism. Who knows, perhaps some shareholders will demand that management hold off on mergers in anticipation of this lookback scrutiny, and if not, perhaps they will sue executives after the FTC and DoJ go to work.</p>\n<p>While they're at it, the Nuremberg Caucus could publish a plan to hire thousands of <em>IRS</em> agents (paid for by taxing billionaires and zeroing out ICE's budget) who will focus exclusively on the ultra-wealthy and especially any supernormal wealth gains coinciding with the second Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>Money talks. ICE agents are signing up with the promise of $50k hiring bonuses and $60k in student debt cancellation. That's peanuts. The Nuremberg Caucus could announce a Crimestoppers-style program with $1m bounties for any ICE officer who a) is themselves innocent of any human rights violations, and; b) provides evidence leading to the conviction of another ICE officer for committing human rights violations. That would certainly improve morale for (some) ICE officers.</p>\n<p>Critics of this plan will say that this will force Trump officials to try to steal the next election in order to avoid consequences for their actions. This is certainly true: confidence in a \"peaceful transfer of power\" is the bedrock of any kind of fair election.</p>\n<p>But this bunch have already <em>repeatedly</em> signaled that they intend to steal the midterms and the next general election:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html\">https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html</a></p>\n<p>ICE agents are straight up telling people that ICE is on the streets to arrest people in Democratic-leaning states (\"The more people that you lose in Minnesota, you then lose a voting right to stay blue\"):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/\">https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/</a></p>\n<p>The only path to fair elections &#8211; and saving America &#8211; lies through mobilizing and energizing hundreds of millions of Americans. They are ready. They are <em>begging</em> for leadership. They want an electoral <em>choice</em>, something better than a return to the pre-Trump status quo. If you want giant crowds at every polling place, rising up against ICE and DHS voter-suppression, then you have to promise people that their vote will <em>mean</em> something.</p>\n<p>Dems have to pick a side. That means being against anyone who is for fascism &#8211; including other Dems. The Nuremberg Caucus should denounce the disgusting child abuse perpetrated by the Trump regime:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children\">https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children</a></p>\n<p>But they should also denounce Democrats who vote to fund that abuse:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html\">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html</a></p>\n<p>The people of Minneapolis (and elsewhere) have repeatedly proven that we outnumber fascists by a huge margin. Dems need to stop demoralizing their base by doing nothing and start demonstrating that they understand the urgency of this crisis.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\n<h1>Hey look at this

The <a href=\"https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard/terminal-bench/2.0\">Terminal Bench 2.0</a> leaderboard is still dominated by Anthropic, OpenAI and Gemini.</p>\n<p>The \"grep tax\" result against <a href=\"https://github.com/toon-format/toon\">TOON</a> was an interesting detail. TOON is meant to represent structured data in as few tokens as possible, but it turns out the model's unfamiliarity with that format led to them spending significantly more tokens over multiple iterations trying to figure it out:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of a figure from a research paper. Introductory text reads: &quot;As schema size increased, TOON showed dramatically increased token consumption for Claude models despite being ~25% smaller in file size. Scale experiments used Claude models only.&quot; Below is &quot;Figure 7: The 'Grep Tax' - TOON Token Overhead at Scale&quot;, a bar chart with a logarithmic y-axis labeled &quot;Tokens&quot; comparing YAML (teal) and TOON (purple) at two schema sizes: S5 (500 tables) and S9 (10,000 tables). At S5, TOON is +138% more tokens than YAML (~1,100 vs ~450). At S9, TOON is +740% more tokens (~50,000 vs ~7,000). Below the chart, explanatory text reads: &quot;The 'grep tax' emerged as schema size scaled. At S5 (500 tables), TOON consumed 138% more tokens than YAML; at S9 (10,000 tables), this grew to 740%. Root cause: models lacked familiarity with TOON's syntax and could not construct effective refinement patterns.&quot;\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/grep-tax.jpg\" />\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2020150077637997013\">@omarsar0</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-engineering\">prompt-engineering</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/paper-review\">paper-review</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/context-engineering\">context-engineering</a></p>",

But I wanted to see them side-by-side, so I dug them all up.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.macosicongallery.com\">my collection of macOS icons</a> isn’t complete. It doesn’t show every variant since the beginning of time, but it’s still interesting to see what’s changed within my own collection.</p>\n<p>So, without further ado, I present the variants in my collection. The years labeled in the screenshots represent the year in which I added the to my collection (not necessarily the year that Apple changed them).</p>\n<p>For convenience, I’ve included a link to the

They did this, in part, because they felt they had a “partner” that could help them move through their workload.</p>\n<p>While this sense of having a “partner” enabled a feeling of momentum, the reality was a continual switching of attention, frequent checking of AI outputs, and a growing number of open tasks. This created cognitive load and a sense of always juggling, even as the work felt productive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm frequently finding myself with work on two or three projects running parallel. I can get <em>so much done</em>, but after just an hour or two my mental energy for the day feels almost entirely depleted.</p>\n<p>I've had conversations with people recently who are losing sleep because they're finding building yet another feature with \"just one more prompt\" irresistible.</p>\n<p>The HBR piece calls for organizations to build an \"AI practice\" that structures how AI is used to help avoid burnout and counter effects that \"make it harder for organizations to distinguish genuine productivity gains from unsustainable intensity\".</p>\n<p>I think we've just disrupted decades of existing intuition about sustainable working practices.

      "content": "<p>If you call a wait function like <code>Wait­For­Single­Object</code> and receive the code <code>WAIT_ABANDONED</code>, what does it mean and what should you do?</p>\n<p>The documentation says that <code>WAIT_ABANDONED</code> means that you successfully claimed a mutex, but the thread that previously owned the mutex failed to release the mutex before it exited. This could be an oversight because the code encountered a code path that forgot to release the mutex. Or it could be because the thread crashed before it could release the mutex.</p>\n<p>The documentation also suggests that &#8220;If the mutex was protecting persistent state information, you should check it for consistency.&#8221; This is to handle the second case: The thread crashes before it can release the mutex. If the purpose of the mutex was to prevent other threads from accessing the data while it is in an inconsistent state, then the fact that the thread crashed while holding the mutex means that the data might still be in that inconsistent state.</p>\n<p>Now, maybe you have no way to check whether the data is in an inconsistent state or have no way to repair it if such an inconsistent state is discovered. (Most people don&#8217;t bother to design their data structures with rollback or transactions, because the point of the mutex was to avoid having to write that fancy code in the first place!) In that case, you really have only two choices.</p>\n<p>One option is to just cover your ears and pretend you didn&#8217;t hear anything. Just continue operating normally and hope that any latent corruption is not going to cause major problems.</p>\n<p>Another option is to give up and abandon the operation. However, if that&#8217;s your choice, you have to give up properly.</p>\n<p>The abandoned state is not sticky; is reported only to the <i>first</i> person to wait for the mutex after it was abandoned. Subsequent waits succeed normally. Therefore, if you decide, &#8220;Oh it&#8217;s corrupted, I&#8217;m not touching it,&#8221; and release the mutex and walk away, then the next person to wait for the mutex will receive a normal successful wait, and they will dive in, unaware that the data structures are corrupted!</p>\n<p>One solution is to add a flag inside your data that says &#8220;Possibly corrupted.&#8221; The code that detects the <code>WAIT_ABANDONED</code> can set that flag, and everybody who acquires the mutex can check the flag to decide if they want to take a chance by operating on corrupted data.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying that you have to do it that way, but it&#8217;s a choice you&#8217;re making. In for a penny, in for a pound.</p>\n<p>In summary, here are some options when you encounter an abandoned mutex:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to fix the problem.</li>\n<li>Ignore the problem.</li>\n<li>Give up and create a warning to others.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Give up and make everybody else think that everything is fine</span>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final choice doesn&#8217;t make sense, because if you&#8217;re going to make everybody else think that everything is fine, then that&#8217;s the same as having everybody else simply ignore the problem. In which case, you may as well ignore the problem too!</p>\n<p><b>Related reading</b>: <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050912-14/?p=34253\" title=\"Understanding the consequences of WAIT_ABANDONED\"> Understanding the consequences of WAIT_ABANDONED</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Don&#8217;t forget that if you get <code>WAIT_ABANDONED</code>, the mutex <i>is owned by you</i>, so make sure to release it.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260209-00/?p=112049\">What should I do if a wait call reports &lt;CODE&gt;WAIT_&lt;WBR&gt;ABANDONED&lt;/CODE&gt;?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing\">The Old New Thing</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The good folks at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MnnG2x\">Orico</a> have sent me their latest power-strip to review. On the surface, the specs are pretty good - two UK sockets, two USB-C for PowerDelivery, and two USB-A for legacy devices.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"Power Strip in black.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67535\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PDC25.webp\" width=\"1200\" />\n\n<p>Let's put it though its paces!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"specs\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-orico-power-strip-uk/#specs\">Specs</a></h2>\n\n<p>Physically, it is a little larger than I was expecting. The two UK sockets are far enough apart to easily get your fingers around the plugs. Similarly, the USB ports are well-spaced. There's a tiny LED to show that power is connected, but it isn't offensively bright.</p>\n\n<p>The UK plug is <em>tiny</em>:</p>\n\n<img alt=\"Photo of a plug, the body is 1.3cm high.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67538\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/plug.webp\" width=\"664\" />\n\n<p>Even better, it comes with a proper fuse! The power cord isn't removable, but is long enough for most purposes.</p>\n\n<p>How much power can it supply? This is what the spec sheet says:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th align=\"right\"></th>\n  <th align=\"center\">V</th>\n  <th align=\"center\">A</th>\n  <th align=\"center\">W</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-A</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">5</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">3</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-A</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">9</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">2.22</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-A</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">12</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">1.67</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-C</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">5</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">3</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-C</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">9</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">2.77</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align=\"right\">USB-C</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">12</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">2.08</td>\n  <td align=\"center\">25</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>But there is a fly in the ointment. While 25W is the most that a single USB-C port can output, the power drops once <em>multiple</em> devices are connected. If you have two or more plugged in, the total output is limited to a mere 15W. Not per-port; total!</p>\n\n<p>25W is already fairly low by PowerDelivery standards, so you won't be using this to power your gaming laptop while charging your tablet and headphones.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"real-world-testing\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-orico-power-strip-uk/#real-world-testing\">Real World Testing</a></h2>\n\n<img alt=\"Two plugs and two USB cables plugged into the unit.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67770\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/double-plug.webp\" width=\"1024\" />\n\n<p>I used my <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/10/gadget-review-plugable-usb-c-voltage-amperage-meter-240w/\">Plugable USB-C Power Meter</a> with some high-quality USB cables. The Orico <em>mostly</em> lives up to its promises.</p>\n\n<p>When charging my laptop from either USB-C port, I was able to measure 22W (12V ⎓ 1.85A). Pretty close to the spec.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I plugged my phone into the other USB-C port, that dropped that down to just under 8W (4.8 ⎓ 1.65A) per port. Again, right on the promised 15W total.</p>\n\n<p>The USB-A port happily delivered 7.5W (5V ⎓ 1.5A) - much lower than expected. That dropped to around 5W (5V ⎓ 1A) once a USC-C load was connected. The C port was only delivering ~10W which wasn't enough to meaningfully charge the laptop.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-orico-power-strip-uk/#final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</a></h2>\n\n<p>The flat plug is handy for plugging this in to those hard-to-reach spaces. The cable is long enough for most uses. The mixture of ports isn't for everyone, but handy if you still have legacy devices you need to power.</p>\n\n<p>It meets the promised specification - but the specs are a bit of a let-down. You can get smaller devices which will do 60W charging from USB-C, and they'll spread that out over all their ports.</p>\n\n<p>The two UK sockets are a nice-to-have, but I can't help feeling that they'll mostly be used for adding additional chargers.</p>\n\n<p>It is cheap-ish - US$30 / £20 - and comes in a range of colours. If you need a long cable and don't need ultra-fast charging, this will do.</p>",

      "content": "<p>My workflow has remained mostly the same for over a decade. I write everything in Vim using the configuration found <a href=\"https://github.com/braintreeps/vim_dotfiles\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. I run Vim from inside of tmux with a configuration found <a href=\"https://github.com/braintreeps/vim_dotfiles/blob/master/tmux_example.conf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. I write things on a git branch, made with the <code>git</code> CLI, then I add them with <code>git add --patch</code> to that branch, trying to run all of the possible linting and tests with <code>git hooks</code> before I waste my time on GitHub Actions. Then I run <code>git up</code> which is an alias to <code>pull --rebase --autostash</code>. Finally I successfully commit, then I copy paste the URL returned by GitHub to open a PR. Then I merge the PR and run <code>git ma</code> to go back to the primary branch, which is an alias to <code>ma = &quot;!f() {git checkout $(git primary) &amp;&amp;git pull;}; f&quot;</code>.</p><p>This workflow, I think, is pretty familiar for anyone working with GitHub a lot. Now you&apos;ll notice I&apos;m not saying <code>git</code> because almost nothing I&apos;m doing has anything to do with <code>git</code>. There&apos;s no advantage to my repo being local to my machine, because everything I need to actually merge and deploy code lives on GitHub. The CI runs there, the approval process runs there, the monitoring of the CI happens there, the injection of secrets happens there. If GitHub is down my local repo does, effectively, nothing. </p><p>My source of truth is always remote, which means I pay the price for <code>git</code> complexity locally but I don&apos;t benefit from it. At most jobs:</p><ul><li>You can&apos;t merge without GitHub (PRs are the merge mechanism)</li><li>You can&apos;t deploy without GitHub (Actions is the deployment trigger)</li><li>You can&apos;t get approval without GitHub (code review lives there)</li><li>Your commits are essentially &quot;drafts&quot; until they exist on GitHub</li></ul><p>This means the following is also true:</p><ul><li>You never work disconnected intentionally</li><li>You don&apos;t use local branches as long-lived divergent histories</li><li>You don&apos;t merge locally between branches (GitHub PRs handle this)</li><li>You don&apos;t use <code>git log</code> for archaeology &#x2014; you use GitHub&apos;s blame/history UI (I often use git log personally but I have determined I&apos;m in the minority on this). </li></ul><p>Almost all the features of <code>git</code> are wasted on me in this flow. Now because this tool serves a million purposes and is designed to operate in a way that almost nobody uses it for, we all pay the complexity price of <code>git</code> and never reap any of the benefits. So instead I keep having to add more aliases to paper over the shortcomings of <code>git</code>. </p><p>These are all the aliases I use at least once a week. </p><pre><code>[alias]\n  up = pull --rebase --autostash\n  l = log --pretty=oneline -n 20 --graph --abbrev-commit\n  # View the current working tree status using the short format\n  s = status -s\n  p = !&quot;git pull; git submodule foreach git pull origin master&quot;\n  ca = !git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -av\n  # Switch to a branch, creating it if necessary\n  go = &quot;!f() { git checkout -b \\&quot;$1\\&quot; 2&gt; /dev/null || git checkout \\&quot;$1\\&quot;; }; f&quot;\n  # Show verbose output about tags, branches or remotes\n  tags = tag -l\n  branches = branch -a\n  remotes = remote -v\n  dm = &quot;!git branch --merged | grep -v &apos;\\\\*&apos; | xargs -n 1 git branch -d&quot;\n  contributors = shortlog --summary --numbered\n  st = status\n  primary = &quot;!f() { \\\n    git branch -a | \\\n    sed -n -E -e &apos;/remotes.origin.ma(in|ster)$/s@remotes/origin/@@p&apos;; \\\n  }; f&quot;\n  # Switch to main or master, whichever exists, and update it.\n  ma = &quot;!f() { \\\n    git checkout $(git primary) &amp;&amp; \\\n    git pull; \\\n  }; f&quot;\n  mma = &quot;!f() { \\\n    git ma &amp;&amp; \\\n    git pull upstream $(git primary) --ff-only &amp;&amp; \\\n    git push; \\\n  }; f&quot;</code></pre><h3 id=\"enter-gitbutler-cli\">Enter GitButler CLI</h3><p><strong>Git&apos;s offline-first design creates friction for online-first workflows, and GitButler CLI eliminates that friction by being honest about how we actually work.</strong></p><p>(Edit: I forgot to add this disclaimer. I am not, nor have ever been an employee/investor/best friends with anyone from GitButler. They don&apos;t care that I&apos;ve written this and I didn&apos;t communicate with anyone from that team before I wrote this.)</p><p>So let&apos;s take the most basic command as an example. This is my flow that I do 2-3 times a day without my aliases. </p><pre><code>git checkout main\ngit pull\ngit checkout -b my-feature\n# or if you&apos;re already on a branch:\ngit pull --rebase --autostash \ngit status</code></pre><p>I do this because <code>git</code> can&apos;t make assumptions about the state of the world. </p><ul><li>Your local repo might be offline for days or weeks</li><li>The &quot;remote&quot; might be someone else&apos;s laptop, not a central server</li><li>Divergent histories are expected and merging is a deliberate, considered act</li></ul><p>However because GitButler is designed with the assumption that I&apos;m working online, we can skip a lot of this nonsense. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-8.png\" width=\"1586\" /></figure><p>It&apos;s status command understands that there is always a remote main that I care about and that when I run a status that I need to understand my status <em>relative</em> to the remote main as it exists right now. Not how it existed the last time I remembered to pull. </p><p>However this is far from the best trick it has up its sleeve. </p><h2 id=\"parallel-branches-the-problem-git-cant-solve\"><strong>Parallel Branches: The Problem Git Can&apos;t Solve</strong></h2><p>You&apos;re working on a feature, notice an unrelated bug, and now you have to stash, checkout, fix, commit, push, checkout back, stash pop. Context switching is expensive and error-prone. </p><p>GitButler effectively hacks a solution into <code>git</code> that fixes this with multiple branches applied simultaneously. Assign files to different branches without leaving your workspace. What do I mean by that. Let&apos;s start again with my status </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"482\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-9.png\" width=\"1582\" /></figure><p>Great looks good. Alright so lets say I make 2 new branches. I&apos;m working on a new feature for adding auth and while I&apos;m working on that, I see a typo I need to fix in a YAML. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"912\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-10.png\" width=\"1586\" /></figure><p>I can work on both things at the same time:</p><pre><code>but stage istar_metrics_text.py feature-auth\nbut stage example.txt bugfix-typo</code></pre><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"804\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-11.png\" width=\"1590\" /></figure><p>And easily commit to both at the same time without doing <em>anything weird</em>. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"946\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-12.png\" width=\"1588\" /></figure><h3 id=\"stacked-prs-without-the-rebase-nightmare\">Stacked PRs Without the Rebase Nightmare</h3><p>Stacked PRs are the &quot;right&quot; way to break up large changes so people on your team don&apos;t throw up at being asked to review 2000 lines, but Git makes them miserable. When the base branch gets feedback, you have to rebase every dependent branch, resolve conflicts, force-push, and pray. Git doesn&apos;t understand branch dependencies. It treats every branch as independent, so <em>you</em> have to manually maintain the stack.</p><p>GitButler solves this problem with First-class stacked branches. The dependency is explicit, and updates propagate automatically.</p><p>So what do I mean. Let&apos;s say I make a new API endpoint in some Django app. First I make the branch. </p><pre><code>but branch new api-endpoints\n# Then add my stuff to it\nbut commit -m &quot;add REST endpoints&quot; api-endpoints\n# Create a stacked branch on top\nbut branch new --anchor api-endpoints api-tests\n</code></pre><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-14.png\" width=\"630\" /></figure><p>So let&apos;s say I&apos;m working on the <code>api-endpoints</code> branch and get some good feedback on my PR. It&apos;s easy to resolve the comments there while leaving my <code>api-tests</code> branched off this <code>api-endpoints</code> as a stacked thing that understands the relationship back to the first branch as shown here. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-15.png\" width=\"762\" /></figure><p>In practice this is just a much nicer way of dealing with a super common workflow. </p><h3 id=\"easy-undo\">Easy Undo</h3><p>Maybe the most requested feature from new <code>git</code> users I encounter is an easier undo. When you mess up in Git, recovery means diving into <code>git reflog</code>, understanding the cryptic output, and hoping you pick the right <code>HEAD@{n}</code>. One wrong move and you&apos;ve made it worse.</p><p>GitButlers <code>oplog</code> is just easier to use. So the basic undo functionality is super simple to understand. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-16.png\" width=\"896\" /></figure><p><code>but undo</code> rolls me back one operation. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"558\" src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2026/02/image-17.png\" width=\"1104\" /></figure><p>To me the mental model of a snapshot makes a lot more sense than the git history model. I do an action, I want to undo that action. This is better than the git option of:</p><pre><code>git log --oneline                 # figure out what you committed\ngit reset --soft HEAD~1           # undo commit, keep changes staged\ngit stash                         # stash the changes\ngit checkout correct-branch       # switch branches\ngit stash pop                     # restore changes (hope no conflict)\ngit add .                         # re-stage\ngit commit -m &quot;message&quot;           # recommit</code></pre><h3 id=\"very-exciting-tool\">Very exciting tool</h3><p>I&apos;ve been using GitButler in my daily work since I got the email that the CLI was available and I&apos;ve really loved it. I&apos;m a huge fan of what this team is doing to effectively remodel and simplify Git operations in a world where almost nobody is using it in the way the tool was originally imagined to be used. I strongly encourage folks go check it out for free at: <a href=\"https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/tutorial-overview\">https://docs.gitbutler.com/cli-guides/cli-tutorial/tutorial-overview</a>.

      "content": "<p>My favorite piece of technology in science fiction isn't lightsabers, flying spaceships, or even robots. It's AI. But not just any AI. My favorite is the one in the TV show <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)\">The Expanse</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you watch The Expanse, the most advanced technology is, of course, the Epstein drive (an unfortunate name in this day and age). In their universe, humanity can travel to distant planets, the Belt, and Mars. Mars has the most high-tech military, which is incredibly cool. But the AI is still what impresses me most. If you watched the show, you're probably wondering what the hell I'm talking about right now. Because there is no mention of AI ever. The AI is barely visible. In fact, it's not visible at all. Most of the time, there aren't even voices. Instead, their computer interfaces respond directly to voice and gesture commands without returning any sass.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>In Season 1, Miller (the detective) is trying to solve a crime. Out of the blue, he just says, \"Plot the course the Scopuli took over the past months.\" The course is plotted right there in his living room. No fuss, no interruptions, no \"OK Google.\" And when he finally figures it out, no one says \"You are absolutely right!\"</p>\n\n<p>He then interacts with the holographic display in real time, asking for additional information and manipulating the data with gestures. At no point does he anthropomorphize the AI. It's always there, always available, always listening, but it never interrupts. </p>\n\n<p>This type of interaction is present throughout the series. In the Rocinante, James Holden will give commands like \"seal bulkhead,\" \"plot intercept course,\" or \"scan for life signs,\" and the ship's computer simply executes. There are no loading screens, no chatbot personality trying to be helpful. The computer doesn't explain what it's doing or ask for confirmation on routine tasks. It just works.</p>\n\n<p>When Holden needs tactical information during a firefight, he doesn't open an app or navigate menus. He shouts questions, and relevant data appears on his helmet display. When Naomi needs to calculate a complex orbital maneuver, she doesn't fight with an interface. She thinks out loud, and the system provides the calculations she needs.</p>\n\n<p>This is the complete opposite of Microsoft's Copilot... Yes, this is about Copilot.</p>\n\n<p>In Microsoft's vision, they think they're designing an AI assistant, an AI copilot that's always there to help. You have Copilot in Excel, in Edge, in the taskbar. It's everywhere, yet it's as useless as you can imagine.</p>\n\n<p>What is Copilot? Is it ChatGPT or a wrapper around it? Is it a code assistant? Is it a search engine? Or wait, is it all of Microsoft Office now? It's attached to every application, yet it hasn't been particularly helpful. </p>\n\n<p>We now use Teams at work, and I see Copilot popping up every time to offer to help me, just like Clippy. OK, fine, I asked for the meaning of a term I hear often in this company. Copilot doesn't know. Well, it doesn't say it doesn't know. Instead, it gives me the definition of what it thinks the term means in general.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine for a second you're a manager and you hear developers talking about issues with Apache delaying a project. You don't know what Apache is, so you ask Copilot. It tells you that the Apache are a group of Native American tribes known for their resilience in the Southwest. If you don't know any better, you might take that definition at face value, never knowing that Copilot has does not have access to any of the company data. Now in the project retro, you'll blame a native American tribe for delaying the project.</p>\n\n<p>Copilot is everywhere, yet it is nowhere. Nobody deliberately opens it to solve a problem. Instead, it's like Google Plus from back in the day. If you randomly clicked seven times on the web, you would somehow end up with a Google Plus account and, for some reason, two YouTube accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Copilot is visible when it should be invisible, and verbose when it should be silent. It interrupts your workflow to offer help you didn't ask for, then fails to provide useful answers when you actually need them. It's the opposite of the AI in The Expanse. It doesn't fade in the background. It is constantly reminding you that you need to use it here and now.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>The Expanse</em>, the AI doesn't have a personality because it doesn't need one. It's not trying to be your friend or impress you with its conversational abilities. It's a tool, refined to perfection. It is not trying to replace your job, it is there to support you. Copilot only exists to impress you, and it fails at it every single time.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Satya should binge-watch The Expanse. I'm not advocating for AI everything, but I am all for creating useful tools. And Copilot, as it currently exists, is one of the least useful implementations of AI I've encountered.</p>\n\n<p>The best technology is invisible. It doesn't announce itself, doesn't demand attention, and doesn't try to be clever. It simply works when you need it and disappears when you don't. I know Microsoft won't read this or learn from it. Instead, I expect Windows 12 to be renamed Microsoft Copilot OS.</p>\n\n<p>In The Expanse, the AI turn people into heroes. In our world, Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, all want to be the heroes. And they will differentiate themselves by trying to be the loudest.</p>",

We probably won't ever understand their methods, but we can at least follow an indicator or two, such as changes to GDP, an aggregated statistic that is deceptively precise, given that it subsumes any number of estimates, qualitative judgments and wild-ass guesses, which are all disguised behind an official statistic that is often published to three decimal places.</p>\n<p>There's plenty to criticize about GDP: a healthy GDP doesn't necessarily mean that the average worker is better off. When your rent goes up, so does GDP. Same with your salary going down (provided this results in more spending by your boss). GDP isn't really a measure of the health of \"The Economy\" &#8211; it's a measure of the parts of \"The Economy\" that make rich people (that is, the Epstein class) better off.</p>\n<p>But what if there was a way to make money from calamitous collapses in GDP? What if the wealthy didn't just win when \"number go up,\" but also when \"number eat shit?\"</p>\n<p>The latest batch of Epstein emails includes a particularly ghoulish exchange between Epstein and his business partner, the anti-democracy activist and billionaire Peter Thiel:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00824843.pdf\">https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00824843.pdf</a></p>\n<p>The email is dated 26 Jun 2016, right after Brexit, and in it, Epstein writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  return to tribalism . counter to globalization. amazing new alliances.  you and I both agreed zero interest rates were too high, as i said in your office.  finding things on their way to collapse , was much easier than finding the next bargain\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a perfect example of what Naomi Klein calls \"disaster capitalism.\" It's been the norm since the crash of 2008, when bankers were made whole through public bailouts and mortgage holders were evicted by the millions to \"foam the runway\" for the banks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wallstreetonparade.com/2012/08/how-treasury-secretary-geithner-foamed-the-runways-with-childrens-shattered-lives/\">https://wallstreetonparade.com/2012/08/how-treasury-secretary-geithner-foamed-the-runways-with-childrens-shattered-lives/</a></p>\n<p>The crash of 2008 turned a lot of people's homes &#8211; their only substantial possessions &#8211; into \"distressed assets\" that were purchased at fire-sale prices by Wall Street investors, who turned around and rented those homes out to people who were now priced out of the housing market at rents that kept them too poor to <em>ever</em> afford a home, under slum conditions that crawled with insects and black mold:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/01/housing-is-a-human-right/\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/01/housing-is-a-human-right/</a></p>\n<p>Note here that economic collapse helps the Epstein class only if society has no social safety net. If Obama had supported homeowners instead of banks, there wouldn't have been a foreclosure crisis and thus there wouldn't have been any \"distressed assets\" flooding the market.</p>\n<p>So it's no surprise that the Epstein class are also obsessed with austerity. Peter Mandelson (British Labour's \"Prince of Darkness\") is a close ally of Epstein's, and also a key figure in the crushing austerity agenda of Blair, Brown and Starmer. He's a machine for turning Parliamentary majorities into distressed assets at scale.</p>\n<p>Same for Steve Bannon, another close Epstein ally, who boasts about his alliances with far-right figures who exalt the capital class and call for deregulation and the elimination of public services: Le Pen, Salvini, Farage. Combine that with Epstein and Thiel's gloating about \"finding things on their way to collapse&#8230;much easier than finding the next bargain,\" and it starts to feel like these guys are even happier with \"number eat shit\" than they are with \"number go up.\"</p>\n<p>Trump is the undisputed king of the Epstein class, and he seems determined to drive \"The Economy\" over a cliff. Take his tariff program, modeled on the McKinley tariffs of 1890, which led to the Panic of 1893, a financial crisis that saw one in four American workers forced into unemployment and 15,000 businesses into bankruptcy (that's a lot of distressed assets!):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893</a></p>\n<p>Then there's Trump's mass deportation program, which will force lots of businesses (farms, restaurants, etc) into bankruptcy, creating another massive pool of distressed assets. Trump's given ICE $75b, while the DoJ Antitrust Division and FTC (which protect Americans from corporate scams) have seen their budgets take a real-terms cut. The majority of DoJ lawyers and FBI agents are working on immigration cases (against workers, not employers, mind!). The Antitrust Division has $275m to fight all of America's corporate crime:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.organizedmoney.fm/p/white-collar-crime-enforcement-in\">https://www.organizedmoney.fm/p/white-collar-crime-enforcement-in</a></p>\n<p>I'm not saying that Trump is <em>trying</em> to induce another massive economic crash. I'm saying, rather, that within his coalition there is a substantial bloc of powerful, wealthy people who are on the hunt for \"things on their way to collapse,\" and who are doubtless maneuvering to frustrate other Trump coalition members who are solely committed to \"number go up.\"</p>\n<p>Even the collapse of crypto creates lots of opportunities to \"buy the dip.\" Not the dip in crypto (crypto's going to zero), but the dip in all the <em>real</em> things people bought with <em>real</em> money they got by borrowing against their shitcoins.</p>\n<p>The thousand-plus children that Epstein lured to his island rape-camp were often \"distressed assets\" in their own right: Julie K Brown's groundbreaking reporting on Epstein for the <em>Miami Herald</em> described how he sought out children whose parents were poor, or neglectful, or both, on the grounds that those children would be \"on their way to collapse,\" too.</p>\n<p>The Epstein class's commitment to destroying \"The Economy\" makes sense when you understand that trashing civilization is \"much easier than finding the next bargain.\" They want to buy the dip, so they're creating the dip.</p>\n<p>They don't need the <em>whole</em> number to go up, just theirs. They know that inclusive economies are more prosperous for society <em>as a whole</em>, but it makes criminals and predators worse off. The New Deal kicked off a period of American economic growth never seen before or since, but the rich despised it, because a prosperous economy is one in which it gets harder and harder to find \"things on their way to collapse,\" and thus nearly impossible to \"find[] the next bargain.\"</p>\n<p>(<i>Image: <a

Write a pitch.md instead.\" src=\"https://www.joanwestenberg.com/content/images/2026/02/ilya-pavlov-hXrPSgGFpqQ-unsplash.jpg\" /><p>Every week, thousands of founders open Canva or Google Slides or, God help them, PowerPoint, and begin the ritual. </p><p>They agonize over fonts, nudge logos three pixels to the left and workshop whether the TAM slide should come before or after the team slide, as though the ordering of these particular runes determines whether capital flows. They search &quot;pitch deck template YC&quot; and download something that looks exactly like every other deck built from a template found by searching &quot;pitch deck template YC.&quot; They use Claude Opus to generate slide decks, or Gamma to beautify scripts.</p><p>And it&apos;s a near-pointless activity.</p><p>I&apos;ve sat through hundreds of pitches at this point and I can tell you with some confidence that the &quot;quality&quot; of the deck is inversely correlated with the quality of the thinking behind it.</p><p>William Zinsser argued in <em>On Writing Well</em> that the act of writing forces clarity - because you can&apos;t write a clear sentence about a thing you don&apos;t understand. The principle applies to startup pitches. I&apos;ve met founders who could deliver a flawless twenty-minute deck, who completely fall apart when asked to write two paragraphs explaining their competitive advantage.</p><p>The deck was performance, and the writing would have been proof.</p><p>Pitch decks are a format optimized for the wrong thing. The entire medium is built around a synchronous, performative moment, and that moment, as it turns out, is a shit way to evaluate whether a business makes sense.</p><p>But we keep using them.</p><p><em>why</em>?</p><p>Part of the reason: venture ecosystem runs on pattern-matching, and the 10-slide deck is a pattern everyone recognizes. Funds have intake processes built around decks. Analysts have workflows for reviewing them. Entire cottage industries exist for deck design, deck feedback, deck optimization. The pitch deck is load-bearing infrastructure in a system that doesn&apos;t love change.</p><p>But the deeper reason is that nobody has proposed a credible replacement, a format that carries the same information with less artifice and more signal. I&apos;d argue there&apos;s an obvious one.</p><p>Write a <code>pitch.md</code> file instead.</p><p>A plain markdown file. The argument for why your company should exist, written in plain text, structured with headers, readable by humans and machines alike - readable in a terminal if it comes to that.</p><p>Make it live in a repository next to your actual code, your README, your documentation. In the McLuhan sense, the medium&apos;s message is: _this company builds things and writes things down clearly.</p><p>Writing and thinking are functionally the same activity, or close enough that the distinction doesn&apos;t matter. When you build a pitch deck, you&apos;re arranging fragments. A bullet point here, a chart there, a big number on a slide by itself for dramatic effect. The format actively discourages connected reasoning. You don&apos;t have to build an argument that flows from one paragraph to the next because you don&apos;t have paragraphs. You have slides, and slides are designed to be self-contained units of impression. The result is that pitch decks test your ability to create impressions, which is a real skill but not the skill that determines whether your business will work.</p><p>Writing a pitch.md forces you to make the connections explicit. If your market analysis doesn&apos;t logically lead to your product thesis, you can&apos;t hide that gap behind a slide transition. The gap sits there on the page, visible // embarrassing // useful.</p><p>Markdown is the native format of the people you&apos;re actually trying to reach. The best technical investors I know, the ones at the firms that reliably pick winners, don&apos;t want to sit through your deck.</p><p>AI tools parse markdown trivially. A VC running deal flow through any Claude Code // literally any automated pipeline (and most serious funds are building these pipelines right now) can ingest a pitch.md, cross-reference it against a live repo, check claims against observable data, and surface inconsistencies in seconds.</p><p>The deck was created for human eyeballs scanning in three minutes and forty-four seconds. A pitch.md file is for a world where the first reader might not be human at all, and where the second reader, the partner who actually writes checks, wants substance they can verify rather than styling they can admire.</p><p>They want to read something. They want to forward something to their partner with a note that says &quot;read this, what do you think.&quot; A pdf of your Keynote presentation is a terrible artifact for that purpose. It&apos;s bloated, it&apos;s archaic, half the slides don&apos;t make sense if you ignore the meaningless diagrams, and nobody is going to read thirty fucking slides on their phone while waiting for coffee anyway. A markdown file is small, format-independent, and (this matters more than people realise) greppable.</p><p>It&apos;s honest too, for whatever that&apos;s worth. Markdown strips away the ability to design your way out of a weak argument. In a deck, you can make a questionable claim feel authoritative by putting it in 72-point Helvetica on a dark background with a lot of whitespace. In a markdown file, a questionable claim looks like exactly what it is: a sentence that needs to be better.</p><p>The format is a forcing function for rigor.</p><p>If you can&apos;t explain your idea clearly in writing, you probably can&apos;t explain it clearly at all, and if you can&apos;t explain it clearly at all, you probaly don&apos;t understand it well enough to build it.</p><p>If you haven&apos;t written your pitch as a plain document, as words on a page making an argument, you&apos;re skipping the hardest and most valuable part of the process. In my experience, the founders who&apos;ve done that homework give better pitches anyway, because they actually know what they&apos;re talking about, and that comes through regardless of whether your slides have drop shadows.</p><p>Write the pitch.md first. You might find you don&apos;t need the deck at all, or you might find that when you do build the deck, it&apos;s better, because you finally know what you&apos;re trying to say.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Last year I first started thinking about what the future of programming\nlanguages might look like now that agentic engineering is a growing thing.\nInitially I felt that the enormous corpus of pre-existing code would cement\nexisting languages in place but now I&#8217;m starting to think the opposite is true.\nHere I want to outline my thinking on why we are going to see more new\nprogramming languages and why there is quite a bit of space for interesting\ninnovation.  And just in case someone wants to start building one, here are some\nof my thoughts on what we should aim for!</p>\n<h2>Why New Languages Work</h2>\n<p>Does an agent perform dramatically better on a language that it has in its\nweights?  Obviously yes.  But there are less obvious factors that affect how\ngood an agent is at programming in a language: how good the tooling around it is\nand how much churn there is.</p>\n<p>Zig seems underrepresented in the weights (at least in the models I&#8217;ve used)\nand also changing quickly.  That combination is not optimal, but it&#8217;s still\npassable: you can program even in the upcoming Zig version if you point the\nagent at the right documentation.  But it&#8217;s not great.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some languages are well represented in the weights but agents\nstill don&#8217;t succeed as much because of tooling choices.  Swift is a good\nexample: in my experience the tooling around building a Mac or iOS application\ncan be so painful that agents struggle to navigate it.  Also not great.</p>\n<p>So, just because it exists doesn&#8217;t mean the agent succeeds and just because it&#8217;s\nnew also doesn&#8217;t mean that the agent is going to struggle.  I&#8217;m convinced that\nyou can build yourself up to a new language if you don&#8217;t want to depart\neverywhere all at once.</p>\n<p>The biggest reason new languages might work is that the cost of coding is going\ndown dramatically.  The result is the breadth of an ecosystem matters less. I&#8217;m\nnow routinely reaching for JavaScript in places where I would have used Python.\nNot because I love it or the ecosystem is better, but because the agent does\nmuch better with TypeScript.</p>\n<p>The way to think about this: if important functionality is missing in my\nlanguage of choice, I just point the agent at a library from a different\nlanguage and have it build a port.  As a concrete example, I recently built an\nEthernet driver in JavaScript to implement the host controller for our sandbox.\nImplementations exist in Rust, C, and Go, but I wanted something pluggable and\ncustomizable in JavaScript.  It was easier to have the agent reimplement it than\nto make the build system and distribution work against a native binding.</p>\n<p>New languages will work if their value proposition is strong enough and they\nevolve with knowledge of how LLMs train.  People will adopt them despite being\nunderrepresented in the weights.  And if they are designed to work well with\nagents, then they might be designed around familiar syntax that is already known\nto work well.</p>\n<h2>Why A New Language?</h2>\n<p>So why would we want a new language at all?  The reason this is interesting to\nthink about is that many of today&#8217;s languages were designed with the assumption\nthat punching keys is laborious, so we traded certain things for brevity.  As an\nexample, many languages — particular modern ones — lean heavily on type\ninference so that you don&#8217;t have to write out types.  The downside is that you\nnow need an LSP or the resulting compiler error messages to figure out what the\ntype of an expression is.  Agents struggle with this too, and it&#8217;s also\nfrustrating in pull request review where complex operations can make it very\nhard to figure out what the types actually are.  Fully dynamic languages are\neven worse in that regard.</p>\n<p>The cost of writing code is going down, but because we are also producing more\nof it, understanding what the code does is becoming more important.  We might\nactually want more code to be written if it means there is less ambiguity when\nwe perform a review.</p>\n<p>I also want to point out that we are heading towards a world where some code is\nnever seen by a human and is only consumed by machines.  Even in that case, we\nstill want to give an indication to a user, who is potentially a non-programmer,\nabout what is going on.  We want to be able to explain to a user what the code\nwill do without going into the details of how.</p>\n<p>So the case for a new language comes down to: given the fundamental changes in\nwho is programming and what the cost of code is, we should at least consider\none.</p>\n<h2>What Agents Want</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s tricky to say what an agent wants because agents will lie to you and they\nare influenced by all the code they&#8217;ve seen.  But one way to estimate how they\nare doing is to look at how many changes they have to perform on files and how\nmany iterations they need for common tasks.</p>\n<p>There are some things I&#8217;ve found that I think will be true for a while.</p>\n<h3>Context Without LSP</h3>\n<p>The language server protocol lets an IDE infer information about what&#8217;s under\nthe cursor or what should be autocompleted based on semantic knowledge of the\ncodebase.  It&#8217;s a great system, but it comes at one specific cost that is tricky\nfor agents: the LSP has to be running.</p>\n<p>There are situations when an agent just won&#8217;t run the LSP — not because of\ntechnical limitations, but because it&#8217;s also lazy and will skip that step if it\ndoesn&#8217;t have to.  If you give it an example from documentation, there is no easy\nway to run the LSP because it&#8217;s a snippet that might not even be complete.  If\nyou point it at a GitHub repository and it pulls down individual files, it will\njust look at the code.  It won&#8217;t set up an LSP for type information.</p>\n<p>A language that doesn&#8217;t split into two separate experiences (with-LSP and\nwithout-LSP) will be beneficial to agents because it gives them one unified way\nof working across many more situations.</p>\n<h3>Braces, Brackets, and Parentheses</h3>\n<p>It pains me as a Python developer to say this, but whitespace-based indentation\nis a problem.  The underlying token efficiency of getting whitespace right is\ntricky, and a language with significant whitespace is harder for an LLM to work\nwith.  This is particularly noticeable if you try to make an LLM do surgical\nchanges without an assisted tool.  Quite often they will intentionally disregard\nwhitespace, add markers to enable or disable code and then rely on a code\nformatter to clean up indentation later.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, braces that are not separated by whitespace can cause issues\ntoo.  Depending on the tokenizer, runs of closing parentheses can end up split\ninto tokens in surprising ways (a bit like the &#8220;strawberry&#8221; counting problem),\nand it&#8217;s easy for an LLM to get Lisp or Scheme wrong because it loses track of\nhow many closing parentheses it has already emitted or is looking at.  Fixable\nwith future LLMs?  Sure, but also something that was hard for humans to get\nright too without tooling.</p>\n<h3>Flow Context But Explicit</h3>\n<p>Readers of this blog might know that I&#8217;m a huge believer in async locals and\nflow execution context — basically the ability to carry data through every\ninvocation that might only be needed many layers down the call chain.  Working\nat an observability company has really driven home the importance of this for\nme.</p>\n<p>The challenge is that anything that flows implicitly might not be configured.\nTake for instance the current time.  You might want to implicitly pass a timer\nto all functions.  But what if a timer is not configured and all of a sudden a\nnew dependency appears?  Passing all of it explicitly is tedious for both humans\nand agents and bad shortcuts will be made.</p>\n<p>One thing I&#8217;ve experimented with is having effect markers on functions that are\nadded through a code formatting step.  A function can declare that it needs the\ncurrent time or the database, but if it doesn&#8217;t mark this explicitly, it&#8217;s\nessentially a linting warning that auto-formatting fixes.  The LLM can start\nusing something like the current time in a function and any existing caller gets\nthe warning; formatting propagates the annotation.</p>\n<p>This is nice because when the LLM builds a test, it can precisely mock out\nthese side effects — it understands from the error messages what it has to\nsupply.</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"k\">fn</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">issue</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">sub</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">UserId</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">scopes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[]</span><span class=\"n\">Scope</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">-&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">Token</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">needs</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">time</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rng</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">return</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Token</span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">sub</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">exp</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">time</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">now</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"n\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">24</span><span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">scopes</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">test</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">&quot;issue creates exp in the future&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">using</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">time</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">time</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">fixed</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;2026-02-06T23:00:00Z&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">using</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rng</span><span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rng</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">deterministic</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">seed</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">issue</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">user</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;u1&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">),</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;read&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">]);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">assert</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">exp</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">time</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">now</span><span class=\"p\">());</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n<h3>Results over Exceptions</h3>\n<p>Agents struggle with exceptions, they are afraid of them.  I&#8217;m not sure to what\ndegree this is solvable with RL (Reinforcement Learning), but right now agents\nwill try to catch everything they can, log it, and do a pretty poor recovery.\nGiven how little information is actually available about error paths, that makes\nsense.  Checked exceptions are one approach, but they propagate all the way up\nthe call chain and don&#8217;t dramatically improve things.  Even if they end up as\nhints where a linter tracks which errors can fly by, there are still many call\nsites that need adjusting.  And like the auto-propagation proposed for context\ndata, it might not be the right solution.</p>\n<p>Maybe the right approach is to go more in on typed results, but that&#8217;s still\ntricky for composability without a type and object system that supports it.</p>\n<h3>Minimal Diffs and Line Reading</h3>\n<p>The general approach agents use today to read files into memory is line-based,\nwhich means they often pick chunks that span multi-line strings.  One easy way\nto see this fall apart: have an agent work on a 2000-line file that also\ncontains long embedded code strings — basically a code generator.  The agent\nwill sometimes edit within a multi-line string assuming it&#8217;s the real code when\nit&#8217;s actually just embedded code in a multi-line string.  For multi-line\nstrings, the only language I&#8217;m aware of with a good solution is Zig, but its\nprefix-based syntax is pretty foreign to most people.</p>\n<p>Reformatting also often causes constructs to move to different lines.  In many\nlanguages, trailing commas in lists are either not supported (JSON) or not\ncustomary.  If you want diff stability, you&#8217;d aim for a syntax that requires\nless reformatting and mostly avoids multi-line constructs.</p>\n<h3>Make It Greppable</h3>\n<p>What&#8217;s really nice about Go is that you mostly cannot import symbols from\nanother package into scope without every use being prefixed with the package\nname.  Eg: <code>context.Context</code> instead of <code>Context</code>.  There are escape hatches\n(import aliases and dot-imports), but they&#8217;re relatively rare and usually\nfrowned upon.</p>\n<p>That dramatically helps an agent understand what it&#8217;s looking at.  In general,\nmaking code findable through the most basic tools is great — it works with\nexternal files that aren&#8217;t indexed, and it means fewer false positives for\nlarge-scale automation driven by code generated on the fly (eg: <code>sed</code>, <code>perl</code>\ninvocations).</p>\n<h3>Local Reasoning</h3>\n<p>Much of what I&#8217;ve said boils down to: agents really like local reasoning.  They\nwant it to work in parts because they often work with just a few loaded files in\ncontext and don&#8217;t have much spatial awareness of the codebase.  They rely on\nexternal tooling like grep to find things, and anything that&#8217;s hard to grep or\nthat hides information elsewhere is tricky.</p>\n<h3>Dependency Aware Builds</h3>\n<p>What makes agents fail or succeed in many languages is just how good the build\ntools are.  Many languages make it very hard to determine what actually needs to\nrebuild or be retested because there are too many cross-references.  Go is\nreally good here: it forbids circular dependencies between packages (import\ncycles), packages have a clear layout, and test results are cached.</p>\n<h2>What Agents Hate</h2>\n<h3>Macros</h3>\n<p>Agents often struggle with macros.  It was already pretty clear that humans\nstruggle with macros too, but the argument for them was mostly that code\ngeneration was a good way to have less code to write.  Since that is less of a\nconcern now, we should aim for languages with less dependence on macros.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a separate question about generics and\n<a href=\"https://zig.guide/language-basics/comptime/\">comptime</a>.  I think they fare\nsomewhat better because they mostly generate the same structure with different\nplaceholders and it&#8217;s much easier for an agent to understand that.</p>\n<h3>Re-Exports and Barrel Files</h3>\n<p>Related to greppability: agents often struggle to understand <a href=\"https://tkdodo.eu/blog/please-stop-using-barrel-files\">barrel\nfiles</a> and they don&#8217;t\nlike them.  Not being able to quickly figure out where a class or function comes\nfrom leads to imports from the wrong place, or missing things entirely and\nwasting context by reading too many files.  A one-to-one mapping from where\nsomething is declared to where it&#8217;s imported from is great.</p>\n<p>And it does not have to be overly strict either.  Go kind of goes this way, but\nnot too extreme.  Any file within a directory can define a function, which isn&#8217;t\noptimal, but it&#8217;s quick enough to find and you don&#8217;t need to search too far.\nIt works because packages are forced to be small enough to find everything with\ngrep.</p>\n<p>The worst case is free re-exports all over the place that completely decouple\nthe implementation from any trivially reconstructable location on disk.  Or\nworse: aliasing.</p>\n<h3>Aliasing</h3>\n<p>Agents often hate it when aliases are involved.  In fact, you can get them to\neven complain about it in thinking blocks if you let them refactor something\nthat uses lots of aliases.  Ideally a language encourages good naming and\ndiscourages aliasing at import time as a result.</p>\n<h3>Flaky Tests and Dev Env Divergence</h3>\n<p>Nobody likes flaky tests, but agents even less so.  Ironic given how\nparticularly good agents are at creating flaky tests in the first place.  That&#8217;s\nbecause agents currently love to mock and most languages do not support mocking\nwell.  So many tests end up accidentally not being concurrency safe or depend on\ndevelopment environment state that then diverges in CI or production.</p>\n<p>Most programming languages and frameworks make it much easier to write flaky\ntests than non-flaky ones.  That&#8217;s because they encourage indeterminism\neverywhere.</p>\n<h3>Multiple Failure Conditions</h3>\n<p>In an ideal world the agent has one command, that lints and compiles and it\ntells the agent if all worked out fine.  Maybe another command to run all tests\nthat need running.  In practice most environments don&#8217;t work like this.  For\ninstance in TypeScript you can often run the code even <a href=\"/2025/8/4/shitty-types/\">though it fails\ntype checks</a>.  That can gaslight the agent.  Likewise\ndifferent bundler setups can cause one thing to succeed just for a slightly\ndifferent setup in CI to fail later.  The more uniform the tooling the better.</p>\n<p>Ideally it either runs or doesn&#8217;t and there is mechanical fixing for as many\nlinting failures as possible so that the agent does not have to do it by hand.</p>\n<h2>Will We See New Languages?</h2>\n<p>I think we will.  We are writing more software now than we ever have — more\nwebsites, more open source projects, more of everything.  Even if the ratio of\nnew languages stays the same, the absolute number will go up.  But I also truly\nbelieve that many more people will be willing to rethink the foundations of\nsoftware engineering and the languages we work with.  That&#8217;s because while for\nsome years it has felt you need to build a lot of infrastructure for a language\nto take off, now you can target a rather narrow use case: make sure the agent is\nhappy and extend from there to the human.</p>\n<p>I just hope we see two things.  First, some outsider art: people who haven&#8217;t\nbuilt languages before trying their hand at it and showing us new things.\nSecond, a much more deliberate effort to document what works and what doesn&#8217;t\nfrom first principles.  We have actually learned a lot about what makes good\nlanguages and how to scale software engineering to large teams.  Yet,  finding\nit written down, as a consumable overview of good and bad language design, is\nvery hard to come by.  Too much of it has been shaped by opinion on rather\npointless things instead of hard facts.</p>\n<p>Now though, we are slowly getting to the point where facts matter more, because\nyou can actually measure what works by seeing how well agents perform with it.\nNo human wants to be subject to surveys, but <a href=\"/2025/6/17/measuring/\">agents don&#8217;t\ncare</a>.  We can see how successful they are and where they\nare struggling.</p>",

Conway, How Do Committees Invent?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Conway's law appears true if you observe organizations and systems as they are, <strong>but the causality is reversed</strong>.</p>\n<p>Systems are not <em>conceived</em> by organizations, but by a single individual or a tight-knit cabal.</p>\n<p>As such, there is no communication structure to emulate. The initial idea is conjured as a gestalt and an organization <em>is built around</em> the system as it comes into existence and operates.</p>\n<p><strong>And thus we invert Conway's law</strong>: A system's design informs the communication structure of the organization that is built around it.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we can ask: what design facilitates the most effective organization?</p>\n<p>There's a whole landscape of solutions here, but I just want to focus on one that I saw work <em>extremely</em> well in the earlier years of AWS.</p>\n<h3>The right way</h3>\n<p>The idea is your system is made up of person-sized services. A person-sized service is one whose codebase is in the realm of a few tens of thousands of lines of code.</p>\n<p>This scale is such that a single developer, working on that codebase full-time, can keep the whole codebase in their head.</p>\n<p><em>N.B. By \"codebase in head\" I don't mean they literally know every line of code. I mean they have a complete picture of all the modules, interfaces, data structures, scaling dimensions, tradeoffs, design decisions, etc.</em></p>\n<p>You want there to be a 1-to-1 mapping between each service and an individual who has that service's code completely loaded into their brain.</p>\n<p>The advantages of having the whole service loaded into an individual brain is hard to overstate.</p>\n<p><strong>It enables a ton of offline mulling</strong>. Your devs know their domain so well, they'll have regular shower-thoughts about how to optimize their service.</p>\n<p><strong>You reach consensus on improvements faster</strong>. Alice has an idea in a shower. She wants Bob's system to start batching requests to hers to improve her cache hit ratio. She tells Bob the idea in the morning. Bob calls over Charlie, whose service would also be affected. In 20 minutes they agree on a path forward. The code is shipped after lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>You actually have fewer outages and issues</strong>. You might think an organization that designs features in 20 minutes and ships them after lunch is going to break things by moving so fast. But in practice, a single engineer with 100% context will anticipate and design around issues better than a design review by a whole team of devs who each have 50% context.</p>\n<p><strong>Quality goes up</strong>. Each owner has a narrative for the health of their codebase: aspirations for future improvements, haunted by lingering jank. They take this holistic view into account when considering all ideas. They have the familiarity needed to do deep, refactoring integrations, but also to safely add hacks when the business needs it.</p>\n<p><strong>Architectural changes are politically manageable</strong>. It's much easier for technical management (i.e. principal engineers) to rearchitect the system, because individual devs have essentially no political power or desire for such. They won't defend their service if it becomes vestigial as long as you give them something else to own.</p>\n<p><strong>Engineers develop faster</strong>. Take a college-hire and give them one of the smaller services. Tell them \"this service is yours, and you are this service, you are one\". This is a sink-or-swim tactic, but a good one. Engineers that can't take individual ownership are toxic to the long-term health of the org. Those that can have a much higher likelihood of evolving into high-value <a href=\"https://blog.sbensu.com/posts/lieutenants/\">lieutenants</a>.</p>\n<h3>The wrong way</h3>\n<p>If you've worked at a traditional company, you've probably seen the inverse of all this. Services aren't owned by individuals, but by whole teams. A team of 8 people might own 3 services. Everyone is kind of vaguely familiar with all of them, but nobody is a master of any one.</p>\n<p>Because nobody is a master, people will tend to implement changes in a purely accretive way. They're afraid to do deeper refactors to integrate changes more holistically.</p>\n<p>And for good reason! When they attempt such deeper refactors without a complete understanding of the service they're operating on, they're stumbling in the dark and cause outages. They do design reviews with the team to try to mitigate this, but nobody knows enough to contribute more than surface-level concerns.</p>\n<p>Managers in charge of teams will resist deprecation of the services their team owns. Not only will they do this, but they will actually invent new services that don't need to exist to justify increasing their headcount (which increases their status).</p>\n<h3>Risks</h3>\n<p><strong>What happens when the owner of a system gets hit by a bus?</strong> Or, less dramatically, leaves the company.</p>\n<p>In practice, engineers in such an org don't <em>only</em> have context on their single service. They'll typically have a decent amount of context on the services theirs touches, and vice versa. After all, who is doing code reviews for whom?</p>\n<p>Most of the devs who've been around for a while will have owned a few different services at different points in their career. When they joined as a college-hire, they were given a tiny metadata caching service. Then someone left and they were given that guy's medium-sized service. Then they had an idea for a brand new system, built it, and now own it as a senior engineer.</p>\n<p>The effect is a senior engineer in the org will have somewhat-stale but easily-refreshable context on a handful of services. It's like riding a bike. This is useful both for bus-factor situations, and also mentoring the juniors who own those services.</p>\n<p>So in a bus-factor situation, there are usually enough seniors around who can keep the lights on until a new owner is found. And in this kind of org, you'll always have a cohort of bright up-and-coming juniors who passed the sink-or-swim test and are ready to take ownership of a bigger service.</p>\n<p><strong>How to manage such an org?</strong> That is, what is the place for managers in this brave world?</p>\n<p>Such a system only needs a few managers, because it won't have <em>that</em> many engineers. It won't have that many engineers because there simply don't exist very many systems that <em>need</em> that many services.</p>\n<p>For context, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3\">AWS S3</a> was built and operated by fewer than 20 engineers in the early years. And if you were to design a storage service on a whiteboard, you might find yourself with 20 or so boxes. There's the storage node, the webserver, the caching layer, the index, the corruption scanner, etc etc etc. It all adds up. Almost no system needs more than a few dozen boxes on the whiteboard.</p>\n<p>In such a world, you only need a handful of managers, and you definitely don't need many layers of management. You want the person in charge of the whole org, a small handful of managers, and then all the engineers.</p>\n<p>The person in charge of the whole org should rely on senior technical <a href=\"https://blog.sbensu.com/posts/lieutenants/\">lieutenants</a> as much as (and perhaps more than) management to maintain visibility.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The previous post discussed two ways to compute the <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number. The first is to compute all the Fibonacci numbers up to the <em>n</em>th iteratively using the defining property of Fibonacci numbers</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>F</em><sub><em>n</em> + 2</sub> = <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> + <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></p>\n<p>with extended integer arithmetic.</p>\n<p>The second approach is to use Binet&#8217;s formula</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = round( φ<sup><em>n</em></sup> / √ 5 )</p>\n<p>where φ is the golden ratio.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear which approach is more efficient. You might naively say that the iterative approach has run time <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>) while Binet&#8217;s formula is <em>O</em>(1). That doesn&#8217;t take into account how much work goes into each step, but it does suggest that eventually Binet wins.</p>\n<p>The relative efficiency of each algorithm depends on how it is implemented. In this post I will compare using Python&#8217;s integer arithmetic and the <code>mpmath</code> library for floating point. Here&#8217;s my code for both methods.</p>\n<pre>from math import log10\nimport mpmath as mp\n\ndef fib_iterate(n):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return a\n\ndef digits_needed(n):\n\n    phi = (1 + 5**0.5) / 2\n    return int(n*log10(phi) - 0.5*log10(5)) + 1\n\ndef fib_mpmath(n, guard_digits=30):\n\n    digits = digits_needed(n)\n\n    # Set decimal digits of precision\n    mp.mp.dps = digits + guard_digits\n\n    sqrt5 = mp.sqrt(5)\n    phi = (1 + sqrt5) / 2\n    x = (phi ** n) / sqrt5\n\n    return int(mp.nint(x))\n</pre>\n<p>Next, here&#8217;s some code to compare the run times.</p>\n<pre>def compare(n):\n    \n    start = time.perf_counter()\n    x = fib_iterate(n)\n    elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start\n    print(elapsed)\n\n    start = time.perf_counter()\n    y = fib_mpmath(n)\n    elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start\n    print(elapsed)\n\n    if (x != y):\n        print(\"Methods produced different results.\")\n</pre>\n<p>This code shows that the iterate approach is faster for <em>n</em> = 1,000 but Binet&#8217;s method is faster for <em>n</em> = 10,000.</p>\n<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; compare(1_000)\n0.0002502090001144097\n0.0009207079999669077\n&gt;&gt;&gt; compare(10_000)\n0.0036547919999065925\n0.002145750000181579\n</pre>\n<p>For larger <em>n</em>, the efficiency advantage of Binet&#8217;s formula becomes more apparent.</p>\n<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; compare(1_000_000)\n11.169050417000108\n2.0719056249999994\n</pre>\n<h2>Guard digits and correctness</h2>\n<p>There is one unsettling problem with the function <code>fib_mpmath</code> above: how many guard digits do you need? To compute a number correctly to 100 significant figures, for example, requires more than 100 digits of working precision. How many more? It depends on the calculation. What about our calculation?</p>\n<p>If we compute the 10,000th Fibonacci number using <code>fib_mpmath(10_000, 2)</code>, i.e. with 2 guard digits, we get a result that is incorrect in the last digit. To compute the 1,000,000th Fibonacci number correctly, we need 5 guard digits.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t need many guard digits, but we&#8217;re guessing at how many we need. How might we test whether we&#8217;ve guessed correctly? One way would be to compute the result using <code>fib_iterate</code> and compare results, but that defeats the purpose of using the more efficient <code>fib_mpmath</code>.</p>\n<p>If floating point calculations produce an incorrect result, the error is likely to be in the least significant digits. If we knew that the last digit was correct, that would give us more confidence that all the digits are correct. More generally, we could test the result mod <em>m</em>. I discussed Fibonacci numbers mod <em>m</em> in <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2017/11/24/distribution-of-fibonacci-numbers-mod-m/\">this post</a>.</p>\n<p>When <em>m</em> = 10, the last digits of the Fibonacci numbers have a cycle of 60. So the Fibonacci numbers with index <em>n</em> and with index <em>n</em> mod 60 should be the same.</p>\n<p>The post I just mentioned links to a paper by Niederreiter that says the Fibonacci numbers ore evenly distributed mod <em>m</em> if and only if <em>m</em> is a power of 5, in which case the cycle length is 4<em>m</em>.</p>\n<p>The following code could be used as a sanity check on the result of <code>fig_mpmath</code>.</p>\n<pre>def mod_check(n, Fn):\n    k = 3\n    base = 5**k\n    period = 4*base\n    return Fn % base == fib_iterate(n % period) % base\n</pre>\n<p>With <em>k</em> = 3, we are checking the result of our calculation mod 125. It is unlikely that an incorrect result would be correct mod 125. It&#8217;s hard to say just how unlikely. Naively we could say there&#8217;s 1 chance in 125, but that ignores the fact that the errors are most likely in the least significant bits. The chances of an incorrect result being correct mod 125 would be much less than 1 in 125. For more assurance you could use a larger power of 5.</p>The post <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/08/computing-large-fibonacci-numbers/\">Computing large Fibonacci numbers</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog\">John D.

      "content": "<p>A few days ago I wrote about Fibonacci numbers and <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/05/fibonacci-certificate/\">certificates</a>. As I pointed out in the article, there&#8217;s no need to certify Fibonacci numbers, but the point of the post was to illustrate the idea of a solution certificate in a simple context. Practical uses of certificates are more complicated.</p>\n<p>This time I want to use Fibonacci numbers to illustrate space tradeoffs. The post on Fibonacci certificates imagined providing someone a pair (<em>F</em>, <em>r</em>) where <em>F</em> is a large Fibonacci number, and <em>r</em> is a certificate proving that <em>F</em> is indeed a Fibonacci number. The goal was to minimize the computational effort to verify <em>F</em>. All the recipient needed to do was compute</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><i>|</i> 5<em>F</em>² − <em>r</em>² |.</p>\n<p>The number <em>F</em> is a Fibonacci number if and only if this number equals 4. The problem with this scenario is that <em>F</em> and <em>r</em> are both large numbers. They require transmitting and storing a lot of bits.</p>\n<p>A much more space-efficient approach would be to transmit the index of the Fibonacci number and have the user compute the number. The example in the certificate post was (12586269025, 28143753123). Since 12586269025 is the 50th Fibonacci number, I could communicate it to someone by simply transmitting the number 50. That saves space, but it puts more computational burden on the recipient.</p>\n<p>Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially with index size, and so the size of the <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number in bits is proportional to <em>n</em>. But the number of bits in <em>n</em> is proportional to log <em>n</em>. When <em>n</em> is large, the difference is dramatic.</p>\n<p>How many bits are in the 1,000,000th Fibonacci number? The <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number is φ<sup><em>n</em></sup>/√5 rounded to the nearest integer, so the number of bits in the millionth Fibonacci number would be</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">log<sub>2</sub> (φ<sup>1000000</sup>/√5) = 1000000 log<sub>2</sub> φ − 0.5 log<sub>2</sub> 5</p>\n<p>which is roughly 700,000. By contrast, one million is a 20 bit number. So transmitting &#8220;1000000&#8221; is far more efficient than transmitting the millionth Fibonacci number.</p>\n<p>What does it take to compute the <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number? For small <em>n</em>, it&#8217;s fast and easy to compute the Fibonacci numbers up to <em>n</em> sequentially using the definition of the sequence. For large enough <em>n</em>, it would be faster to compute φ<sup><em>n</em></sup>/√5. However, the former requires (extended) integer arithmetic, and the latter requires (extended) floating point arithmetic. It&#8217;s not clear where the crossover point would be where floating point would be more efficient. That&#8217;s the topic of the <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/08/computing-large-fibonacci-numbers/\">next post</a>.</p>The post <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/08/time-space-tradeoffs/\">Fibonacci numbers and time-space tradeoffs</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog\">John D.

Everyone occasionally thinks \"what if I just ran away?\" or \"what would happen if I dropped this glass?\" For most people it is just a passing moment; but for Hayley it is something more intense.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is smuggled to the reader hidden within poop jokes, tales of teenage awkwardness, and millennial angst. It is consistently funny which makes the sudden switch to pathos all the more effective. It morphs into a tender tale of loss, loneliness, and something else beginning with L which will make me sound erudite.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't describe it quite as a \"self-help\" book, but I think that's clearly part of the intention. Lots of people need to know that their (parasocial) friends find therapy useful. Having someone influential describe the journey to better mental health in such a relatable way will undoubtedly help others.</p>",
