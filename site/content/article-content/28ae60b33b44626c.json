  "content": "<p>Mike Masnick, writing for Techdirt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Read that again. If West Virginia wins — if an actual court\norders Apple to start scanning iCloud for CSAM — then every\nimage flagged by those mandated scans becomes <em>evidence obtained\nthrough a warrantless government search conducted without\nprobable cause</em>. The Fourth Amendment’s exclusionary rule means\ndefense attorneys get to walk into court and demand that evidence\nbe thrown out. And they’ll win that motion. It’s not even a\nparticularly hard case to make.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/27/west-virginia-apple-csam\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘West Virginia’s Anti-Apple CSAM Lawsuit Would Help Child Predators Walk Free’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>"
