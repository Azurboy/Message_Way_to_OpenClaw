I couldn’t stop it from my phone. I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb.</p>\n<p>I said “Check this inbox too and suggest what you would archive or delete, don’t action until I tell you to.” This has been working well for my toy inbox, but my real inbox was too huge and triggered compaction. During the compaction, it lost my original instruction 🤦‍♀️</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/summeryue0/status/2025836517831405980\">Summer Yue</a></p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-agents\">ai-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/openclaw\">openclaw</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a></p>"
