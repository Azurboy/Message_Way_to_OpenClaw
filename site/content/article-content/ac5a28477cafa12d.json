The challenge was coming up with a use case for binary search where the data could be naturally sorted in a way that would benefit from binary search.</p>\n<p>One of Claude's suggestions was looking up information about unicode codepoints, which means searching through many MBs of metadata.</p>\n<p>I had Claude write me a spec to feed to Claude Code - <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/pull/90#issue-4001466642\">visible here</a> - then kicked off an <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/\">asynchronous research project</a> with Claude Code for web against my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research\">simonw/research</a> repo to turn that into working code.</p>\n<p>Here's the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/unicode-explorer-binary-search#readme\">resulting report and code</a>. One interesting thing I learned is that Range request tricks aren't compatible with HTTP compression because they mess with the byte offset calculations. I added <code>'Accept-Encoding': 'identity'</code> to the <code>fetch()</code> calls but this isn't actually necessary because Cloudflare and other CDNs automatically skip compression if a <code>content-range</code> header is present.</p>\n<p>I deployed the result <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/unicode-binary-search\">to my tools.simonwillison.net site</a>, after first tweaking it to query the data via range requests against a CORS-enabled 76.6MB file in an S3 bucket fronted by Cloudflare.</p>\n<p>The demo is fun to play with - type in a single character like <code>ø</code> or a hexadecimal codepoint indicator like <code>1F99C</code> and it will binary search its way through the large file and show you the steps it takes along the way:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Animated demo of a web tool called Unicode Explore. I enter the ampersand character and hit Search. A box below shows a sequence of HTTP binary search requests made, finding in 17 steps with 3,864 bytes transferred and telling me that ampersand is U+0026 in Punctuation other, Basic Latin\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/unicode-explore.gif\" />\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/algorithms\">algorithms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/http\">http</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/research\">research</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/tools\">tools</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/unicode\">unicode</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/vibe-coding\">vibe-coding</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/http-range-requests\">http-range-requests</a></p>"
