  "content": "<p>In my <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/10/showboat-and-rodney/\">post about my Showboat project</a> I used the term \"overseer\" to refer to the person who manages a coding agent. It turns out that's a term tied to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantations_in_the_American_South#Overseer\">slavery and plantation management</a>. So that's gross! I've edited that post to use \"supervisor\" instead, and I'll be using that going forward.</p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/language\">language</a></p>"
